<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h2>


<p><i>February 20, 1890.</i> There is not a
moment of my life that you have shared
with me which I cannot recall with a distinctness
fairly sunlit. My joys and my
sorrows, my triumphs and my failures,
have faded one by one from emotions
into memories, quickening neither pulse
nor thought when they recur to me,
while you alone can set both throbbing.
And though for years I have known that
if you enshrined any one in your heart it
would be some one worthier of you, yet
I have loved you truly, and whatever I
have been in all else, in that one thing,
at least, I have been strong. Nor would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>I part with my tenderness for you, even
though it has robbed me of contentment;
for all the pleasures of which I can dream
cannot equal the happiness of loving you.
To God I owe life, and you, Maizie, have
filled that life with love; and to both I
bow my spirit in thanks, striving not to
waste his gift lest I be unworthy of the
devotion I feel for you.</p>

<p>If I were a stronger man, I should not
now be sobbing out my heart's blood
through the tip of a pen. Instead of
writing of my sorrow, I should have battled
for my love despite all obstacles.
But I am no Alexander to cut the knot
of entanglements which the fates have
woven about me, and so, Midas-like, I
sit morbidly whispering the hidden grief,
too great for me to bear in silence longer.</p>

<p>I can picture my first glimpse of you
as vividly as my last. That dull rainy
day of indoor imprisonment seems almost
to have been arranged as a shadowbox
to intensify the image graved so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>deeply on my memory. The sun came,
as you did, towards the end of the afternoon,
as if light and warmth were
your couriers. When I shyly entered the
library in answer to my father's call, you
were standing in the full sunlight, and
the thought flashed through my mind
that here was one of the angels of whom
I had read. You were only a child of
seven,&mdash;to others, I suppose, immature
and formless; yet even then your eyes
were as large and as serious as they are
to-day, and your curling brown hair had
already a touch of fire, as if sunshine
had crept thereinto, and, liking its abiding-place,
had lingered lovingly.</p>

<p>"Don," cried my father, as I stood
hesitating in the doorway, "here's a new
plaything for you. Give it a welcome
and a kiss."</p>

<p>I hung back, half in shyness, and half
in fear that you were of heaven, and
not of earth, but you came forward and
kissed me without the slightest hesitation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>The details are so clear that I
remember you hardly had to raise your
head, though I was three years the older.
Your kiss dispelled all my timidity, and
from the moment of that caress I loved
you. Not that I am so foolish as to
believe I then felt for you what now I
feel, but by the clear light of retrospect
I can see that your coming brought a
new element into my life,&mdash;an element
which I loved from the first, though with
steadily deepening intensity, and I cannot
even now determine at what point a
boy's devotion became a lover's.</p>

<p>To the silent and lonely lad you were
an inspiration. What I might have
grown to be had you not been my father's
ward I do not like to think, for
I was not a strong boy, and my shyness
and timidity had prompted me to much
solitude and few friends, to much reading
and to little play. But it was decreed
that you were to be the controlling influence
of my life, and in the first week
you worked a revolution in my habits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
I wonder if now, when you see so many
men eager to gratify your slightest wish,
you ever think of your earliest slave,
whom you enticed to the roof to drop
pebbles or water on the passers-by, and
into the cellar to bury a toy soldier deep
in the coal? Does memory ever bring
back to you how we started to paint the
illustrations in Kingsborough's Mexican
Antiquities, or how we built a fire round
a doll on the library rug, in imitation of
the death of an Inca of Peru as pictured
in dear old Garcilasso de la Vega's Royal
Commentaries? You were a lazy child
about reading, but when not tempting
me into riotous mischief, you would sit
by me in the library and let me show
you the pictures in the old books, and
I smile now to think what my running
versions of the texts must have been.
Our favorite books were the Nuremberg
Chronicle and De Bry's Voyages, for the
pictures of which, since the Latin was
beyond me, I invented explanations and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
even whole stories,&mdash;stories over which
you grew big-eyed and sleepless, and
which we both came to believe so firmly
that we never dreamed them to be the
cause for the occasional outburst of
laughter from my father, when he was
in the library.</p>

<p>Even in those days you veiled your
witchery and mischief-loving nature behind
that serious face with its curved but
unsmiling mouth. Keen as many of our
pleasures were and blithe as were our
pranks, I can scarcely remember a smile
upon your face. Now and then the merriest
of laughs rang out, fairly infectious
in its happiness and joy, but of so rare
recurrence as to win for you the sobriquet
of "Madam Gravity." Your inscrutability
allured and charmed me then as
I have seen it fascinate others since. I
shall never understand you, and yet I
think I misunderstand you less than
others do, for you cannot hide from me
the quick thought and merry nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
which you keep so well hidden from
them; and often when others think you
most abstracted or sedate, I know you are
holding high carnival with Puck and Momus.
Again and again I have noted your
gravity in the most humorous situations
or with the most ridiculous of persons,
and have smiled in secret with you. Last
summer, when my mother won such a
laugh by telling, as something that had
happened to her personally, the old story
from Peele's "Merrie Conceits" which
we had read as children, you looked grave,
though the incident had twice the humor
to you that it had to the others. In my
own merriment I could not help glancing
at you, and though neither of us laughed,
we understood each other's amusement.
Evidently you were not used to having
your mood comprehended, for after a moment
you seemed to realize that I was
responding to what you had thought unknown
to all. You looked startled and
then puzzled, and I suppose that I be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>came
even more of a mystery to you
than ever. You could not know that my
knowledge of you came from those early
days when your nature was taking shape.
Without my memory of you as a child
you would be as great an enigma to me
as to the rest of your friends, and so no
doubt it is a small thing in which to glory.
But it gives me joy to feel that I understand
you better, and at this very moment
know more of your thoughts than your
husband ever will.</p>

<p>I owe to you many dark closetings and
whippings that I never deserved. My
mother complained that from being a
troublesome child I had become a fiend
of mischief, but my father laughed and
predicted that you would make a man
of me. I wonder if you ever think of
him, and what your thought is? We
both so loved him that I cannot believe
he has passed entirely out of your heart.
How ready he was to be our comrade!
Whether tired or busy he would join us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
not as mentor but as playfellow; and now
that I know what there was to depress
his spirits at that time, I marvel at his
cheer and courage. Would that I had
one half of the bravery with which he
met his troubles!</p>

<p>Perhaps he was right in his assumption
that you would have made a man of me.
I do not recollect any act of mine which
bore the semblance of courage except
the rescue of the street dog from those
boys. I hated to see the poor beast tortured,
but I feared the roughs, and so
stood faltering while you charged among
them. Not till one of them struck you
was I driven to help, but I can still feel
the fury which then took possession of
me. I was blind with rage, and a great
weight seemed pressing on my chest as
I rushed among the boys and fought,
hardly conscious of the blows I gave or
received; indeed, the whole thing was a
haze until I found myself sitting on the
sidewalk, crying. For days I went about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
with a bandage over my eye; but my
father drank my health that night, and I
remember his pat of approval, and hear
his "Bravo, Donald, I'm proud of you."
It was significant that I received all the
praise, and you none; my courage was
questionable, yours was not.</p>

<p>Those happy, thoughtless years! The
one kill-joy was my mother, and she
made your life and mine so grievous
with her needless harshness, quick temper,
and neglect of our comfort that I
think she must have made my father's
equally miserable. Dimly I can recollect
her sudden gusts of temper, and his
instant dismissal of us from the room
when they began. Do you remember
how he used to come up to the nursery
to smoke, often staying till our bedtime,
and then how we could hear him go downstairs
and out of the front door? We
did not know that he went to his club,
nor at what hour he returned; and if we
had it would have meant nothing to us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
But we both knew he found no pleasure
with my mother, and we felt he was
right, for in avoiding her he was but
doing what was our chief endeavor. I
have heard many express admiration for
her beauty, for her church and charitable
work, for her brilliancy in society, for
her executive ability, and for her general
public spirit. Her neglect of family
duties, her extravagance, her frequent
absences, and her fatigued petulance
when at home were known only to
her household. Our servants rarely remained
a month with us,&mdash;were changed
so often as to destroy all possibility of
comfort; but we three were not free to
follow their example, and so our misery
made us the dearer to one another. I
am proud to think that, close as we drew
together, my father never uttered in my
presence a single word of criticism or complaint
against my mother, and I should
be the better man if, instead of writing
these unfilial words, I left them unsaid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Indeed, I will not spend more of my evening
on these old memories, but begin on
my work.</p>

<p>Do you remember, Maizie, how my father
taught us to give him and each other
a parting word? "Good-night, father.
Good-night, Maizie. God bless you both,"
it used to be. He sleeps now in his grave,
and three years ago you barred your door
to me, but still I can say as of old, "Good-night,
Maizie. God bless and keep you,
dear."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h2>


<p><i>February 21.</i> To put all this on paper
is weak and aimless, yet it seems to
ease my sadness. I suppose a scribbler
unconsciously comes to write out whatever
he feels, as a nervous woman plays
her emotions away on a piano. If this is
so, why should not I salve my grief in
any way that lessens it? Those old days
had such happiness in them that the mere
memory brings some to me, and to sit
here at my study table and write of the
past is better than idle dwelling on the
present.</p>

<p>You were jubilant when first told
that we were all to go to Europe for a
summer, and laughed at my fears and
despondency. Could I have had an intuition
of coming evil, or was my alarm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
due to the engravings of those terrible
sea-monsters with which Mercator populated
the oceans in his "Atlas sive Cosmographicæ,"
and to the pictures and
tales in bloodthirsty old Exquemelin's
"Bucaniers of America"? Our notions
of what the trip meant were evidently not
very clear, for at once we set to storing
up provisions, and weeks before the
time of sailing we were the proud possessors
of a cracker-box full of assorted
edibles, a jar of olives we had pilfered,
and a small pie you had cajoled the cook
into making for us. How we loved and
gloated over that pie! Daily we sorted
our sea-stores, added new supplies, and
ate what clearly could be kept no longer.
My mother found us one day deeply engrossed
in the occupation, cuffed us both,
and sent the olives back to the pantry
and the tin box to the ash-barrel. As
for the pie, such hot words passed about
it between "Madame" and "Monsieur
Philippe" that our cook left us without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
warning. We were again punished for
being the cause of his desertion, and that
evening father dined at his club.</p>

<p>The different effects my mother's gusts
of anger had on you and on me were curiously
distinctive. You met them fearlessly
and stubbornly, while to me the
moments of her fury were moments in
which I could scarcely breathe, and of
which I felt the terror for hours after.
I sometimes wonder if the variance was
because I had learned to fear the outbursts
even as a baby, whereas your
character had partly formed before you
encountered them. Who knows but a
change of circumstances might have made
me the fearless one, and you the timorous?
At least I should be glad to think
that I might have been like you in courage
and spirit, even though it is impossible
to imagine that you could ever be
like me. It is a singular turn of life's
whirligig that when my mother tried to
pain you last autumn by her cruel re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>marks,
you were helpless to retort, and
owed your escape to my help.</p>

<p>What a delight the ocean voyage was
to us! Those were the times of ten-day
trips, still dear to all true lovers of the
sea; and had our wishes been consulted,
thrice ten would have been none too
long for our passage. The officers, the
crew, the stewards, and the passengers
were no more proof against your indefinable
spell than was I, and it seemed
quite as if the boat were your private
yacht, with all on board seeking only to
serve you. Our pleasure was so intense
that we planned an ideal future, in which
I was to become the captain of a steam-ship,
and you were to live on the vessel
in some equally delightful if impossible
capacity.</p>

<p>The last time I was in Paris, I walked
several miles merely to look at the outside
of our pension, and then went on and
sat dreaming in the little park near it in
which we passed so many hours of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
stay in that city. As of old, the place
was full of children and nurses, and I
understood what had puzzled me not a
little in recollection,&mdash;how you and I,
without mingling with them, had learned
so quickly the language they chattered.
Do you remember their friendly advances,
met only by rebuffs? My coldness
flowed from shyness, and yours from
a trait that people to this day call haughtiness,
but which I know to be only a fastidious
refinement that yields acquaintance
to few and friendship to fewer.
From the moment you came into my life
I craved no other friend, and you seemed
equally content. What was there in me
that won for me what you gave so rarely?
Was there an instinct of natural sympathy,
or was it merely pity for me in the
loving heart you masked behind that subtle
face?</p>

<p>It is indicative of what children we
still were that during the whole of our
sojourn in Paris neither of us was con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>scious
that our standard of living had
changed. We lodged in a cheap pension;
instead of our own carriage we
used the omnibus; and a thousand other
evidences told the story of real economy;
yet not one we observed except the disappearance
of our <i>bonne</i>, and this was
noted, not as a loss, but as a joy to both.</p>

<p>After the nurse was gone my father
became more than ever our comrade, and
a better one two children never had.
Oh, those long excursions to Versailles,
Montmartre, and Fontainebleau, our boat
trips up and down the Seine, and our
shorter jaunts within the city! What
happiness it was to us when he came in
whistling and cried, "Donald, Maizie, you
are horribly bad children, and I'm going
to take you on a lark to punish you!"
After time spent in filling our lunch-basket
with big rolls bought at the <i>boulangerie</i>,
a few sous' worth of cherries or other
fruit lengthily bargained for with the <i>fruitier</i>,
and a half litre of cheap wine, plus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
whatever other luxuries our imaginations
or our appetites could suggest, away we
would go for a long day of pure delight,
whether passed under green trees or wandering
through galleries and museums.
My father was an encyclopædia of information,
and had the knack of making
knowledge interesting to the child mind.
He could re-create a bygone period from
a battle-axe or a <i>martel de fer</i>, the personality
of a queen from her lace ruff
or stomacher, and the history of plant
growth from a fern or flower. If his
mind had been allowed to expand when
he was young, instead of being stunted in
a broker's office, I believe he might have
been one of the world's great writers or
critics.</p>

<p>Under such stimulating tutelage our
progress in those two years was really
wonderful. No subject my father touched
upon could remain dull; we were at a
receptive age when the mind is fresh and
elastic for all that interests it, and Paris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
was a great picture-book to illustrate what
he taught us. We did not know we were
studying far deeper into subjects than
many educated people ever go. I laugh
still at your telling the old German on the
train to Sèvres the history of the Faust
plot, and at his amazed "Ach, zo!" to
hear such erudition pour from your childish
lips. I think you were the cleverer
and the quicker, but there was no competition,
only fellowship about our learning.
I suppose you were above rivalry, as you
are above all mean things.</p>

<p>And that is your chief glory to me.
In those seven years of closest companionship,
and in these last three years of
lesser intercourse but far keener observation,
I have never known you to do a
mean thing or to speak a mean thought.
I almost feel it treason to couple the word
with you, or deny a trait so impossible
for you to possess, and of which you have
always shown such scorn and hatred. At
this moment I know that I should only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
have to speak to part you forever from&mdash;Ah,
what foolishness I am writing, tempting
me to even greater meanness than
his, and so to deserve the greater contempt
from you! Thinking me base,
you closed your doors to me three years
ago, and I love you the better that not
even for auld lang syne could you pardon
what is so alien to you. If the day
ever comes when you again admit me to
your friendship, I shall be happy in knowing
that you think me above baseness or
meanness; for you would not compound
with them, Maizie, be the circumstances
what they might.</p>

<p>Our Paris life would not have been so
happy and careless but for the slight part
my mother had in it. So little did we
see of her in those years that I think of
her scarcely as one of us. I remember
dimly a scene of hot anger between her
and my father,&mdash;he standing passively
by the high porcelain stove, while she
raged about the room. So great was her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
fury that once, in passing, as I crouched
scared and silent on the sofa, she struck
me,&mdash;a blow which brought my father
to my side, where he stood protectingly
while the storm lasted, with his hand
resting lovingly on my shoulder. My
vague impression is that the outburst was
only a protest against the poor lodgings,
but it may have occurred when some explanation
took place between my parents.
I can see my mother now, sitting on the
little balcony overlooking the garden of
our pension, snarling an ill-natured word at
us as you and I tried to play consultation
games of chess against my father. He
gave us odds at first of the rook and two
pawns, but finally only of a knight. Oh,
the triumph of those victories! How
we gloried in them, and how delighted
our antagonist was when we conquered
him! Little we minded what my mother
did except when we happened to be
alone with her, and I think that the dear
father played bad chess with us rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
than good at the cafés, and made us his
companions wherever he went, to save us
from her severity.</p>

<p>I can recall very clearly her constant
difficulties with our landlady and the
servants, which finally culminated in a
request that we should seek lodgings
elsewhere. Do you recollect Madame
Vanott's clasping us both in her arms
and filling our hands with bonbons, when
the time of parting came? I do not
know where we removed to, my sole remembrance
of the next few weeks being
of my mother's complaints of lodgings,
food, servants, and French life generally.
We moved three times within a month,
fairly expelled by our landlords because
they could not live at peace with "la
Madame." Our last exodus began in an
angry scene between her and the housewife,
in which a gendarme played a part,
and from which you and I fled. The
next morning we learned that my mother
had determined to return to America,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and leave us to live our own life. Three
days later we said emotionless good-bys,
my father going as far as Havre with
her.</p>

<p>Her departure set us asking questions,
and my father's replies explained many
things which, in our childish talks, we
had gravely discussed. He told us how
his own wealth had been lost in Wall
Street, barely enough being left for a
competence even in Europe. Of my mother's
leaving us he spoke sadly. "She
never pretended to care for me," he said,
"but I loved her and was willing to marry
her. The wrong was mine, and we should
not blame her if, when I can no longer
give what was her price, she does not
choose to continue the one-sided bargain."
At the time her absence seemed
to you and me only a relief, but now, as
I look back, I know that my father never
ceased to love her,&mdash;all the more, perhaps,
because his love had never been requited,&mdash;and
that separation must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
been the final wrecking of his life. Yet
from the day she left us I never heard
him speak an angry word, and sorrow that
would have crushed most men seemed to
make him the gentler and sweeter. I
wish&mdash;Ah! the clock is striking three,
and if I am to bring working power to
working hours I must stop writing.</p>

<p>Good-night, dear one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h2>


<p><i>February 22.</i> After my mother left
us we did not stay in Paris, but went to
Ischl, which we made merely the point
of departure for walking tours which
often lasted for weeks. Several times I
have spoken of the region to you, hoping
to draw from you some remark proving
a recollection of those days, but you always
avoid reply. Yet I am sure they are
not forgotten, for miles of the Tyrol and
Alps are as familiar to me as the garnishings
of a breakfast-table. My father
had the tact and kindly humor that make
a man equally at home and welcome in
<i>Gasthaus</i> and <i>Schloss</i>. Though we traveled
with only a knapsack, his breeding
and education were so patent to whomsoever
we met that we spent many a
night inside of doors with armorial coats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
of many quarterings carved above them,
and many a day's shooting and fishing
followed. Yet pleasant as was this impromptu
and "gentle" hospitality, I
think we were all quite as happy when
our evenings were spent among the peasants,
drinking beer, talking of farming and
forestry, singing songs, or listening to the
blare of the peripatetic military band.</p>

<p>My father was a fine German scholar,
and you and I acquired the language
as quickly and as easily as we learned
French. We always had books in our
pockets, and used to lie for hours under
the trees, reading aloud. Long discussions
followed over what we had conned,
enriched by the thousand side-lights my
father could throw on any subject. To
most people reading is a resort to save
themselves from thinking, but my father
knew that pitfall, and made us use books
as a basis for thought on our own part.
After a volume was finished we would
each write a criticism of it, and the com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>parison
of my boyish attempts with his
brilliant, comprehensive, and philosophic
work taught me more of writing than all
the tuition I ever had.</p>

<p>My craving for knowledge, always
strong, became inordinate, probably because
the acquisition of it was made so
fascinating that I learned without real exertion.
I began to find limits even to
my father's erudition, and chafed under
them. He reviewed his Greek that he
might impart it to us, as he had long
before taught us Latin, and together we
all three studied Spanish and Italian.
I was not satisfied, for my desire for the
one thing my father was unable to teach
was not appeased by the twenty which he
could. I begged for regular tuition, and,
indulgent as he always was, he took us to
Heidelberg, where I was enrolled in the
gymnasium. Yet the long hours of separation
that this entailed made little difference
in our relations, since except for
these we were inseparable. Whenever my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
school-work left us time to quit Heidelberg
we made walking tours, and we availed
ourselves of the summer holiday to see
far-away lands. The great libraries were
our chief goals, but everything interested
us, from the archaic plough we saw in
the field to the masterpiece of the gallery.
I do not know whether I was dull for my
years, but I do know that you were precocious
and had no difficulty in keeping up
with me in my studies. Indeed, thanks to
your own brightness and to the long hours
spent with my father while I was reciting,
you went ahead of me in many respects.
It makes me very happy now to think of
what you two were to each other, and to
know that you are so largely indebted to
him for the depth and brilliance of mind
that I hear so often commented upon.
And I love you all the better because you
made those years so happy to him by
your love and companionship.</p>

<p>Last winter Mrs. Blodgett accused me
of being a misogynist, and proved her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
point by asking me to tell the color of Agnes's
eyes. You and Agnes only laughed
when I miscolored them, but Mrs. Blodgett
was really nettled. "There!" she
said. "Apparently, Agnes and I are the
only women you ever go to see or pretend
to care for, and yet you think so
little of us that you don't know the color
of our eyes." Had she only asked me to
describe your eyes in place of Agnes's
I should not have erred, but I suppose
even then the world would be justified in
thinking I do not care for woman's society.
Certainly you, of all others, have
the right to think so, after my twice
refusing your friendship; and yet it is
my love of you far more than my studies
or shyness that has made me indifferent
to other women. And so far from
being a misogynist, I care for as few
men as women. You perhaps recall how
much apart I kept myself from my fellow
students, and how my father had to urge
me to join them in the fencing and chess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
contests? Later, at the university, after
you had left us, I entered more eagerly
into the two pastimes, and succeeded in
making myself a skilled swordsman. As
for chess, I learned to play the game
you tested last October on the veranda
of My Fancy. You looked courteously
grave when, after our initial battle, I had
to ask from you the odds of a pawn,
and never dreamed that I fathomed your
secret triumph over your victory. You
are so delightfully human and womanly,
after all, Maizie, to any one who can
read your thoughts. It is a pleasure to
see your happiness in the consciousness
of your own power, and I grudge you
victory over me no more than over other
men. Yet while you play better chess,
I think you could not conquer me quite
as easily if I were not much more interested
in studying the player than the
play. Perhaps but for you I should have
made friends, for later, at Leipzig, despite
my shyness and studiousness, I seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
fairly popular; but so long as I had you
I cared for no other friend, and after
our separation I could form no new tie.
Neither in love nor in friendship have
you ever had a rival in my heart.</p>

<p>Our happiness ended the day when
Johann, the poor factotum of our lodging-place,
found us in the castle park and
summoned us back to the house, where
my father and Mr. Walton were awaiting
you. The news that we were to be parted
came so suddenly that we could not believe
it. I stood in stunned silence, while
you declared that you would not go with
your uncle; even in that terrible moment
speaking more like a queen issuing orders
than like a rebel resisting authority. We
both appealed to my father, and the tears
stood in his eyes as he told us we must
be parted. Mr. Walton sat with the cool
and slightly bored look that his worldly
face wears so constantly, and I presume it
was impossible for him to understand our
emotion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>Your luggage had been packed while
we were being summoned, and I carried
your bag down to the carriage, in the endeavor
to do you some last little service.
We did not even go through the form of
a farewell, but, tearless and speechless,
held each other's hands till my father
gently separated us. To this day the
snap of a whip causes me to catch my
breath, it brings back so vividly the crack
with which Mr. Walton's cabman whipped
up his horse. Fate was merciful, for she
gave me no glimpse of the future, and
so left me the hope that we should not
be parted long. I question if the delicate
lad of those days could have borne
the thought that our separation, enforced
by others, would in time be continued by
you.</p>

<p>The life was too happy to last; and
yet I do not know why I write that, for
I do not believe that God's children are
born to be wretched, and I would sooner
renounce my faith in him than believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
him so cruel to his own creations. The
sadness and estrangement in my life are
all of human origin, and mine, it seems
to me, has been a fuller cup of bitterness
than most men have to drink. Or am I
only magnifying my own sufferings, and
diminishing those of my fellow mortals?
To the world I am a fortunate man, with
promise of even greater success. Do all
the people about me, who seem to be
equally prosperous, bury away from sight
some grief like mine that beggars joy?</p>

<p>Can you, Maizie, in the tide and triumph
of your beauty and wealth, hide
any such death-wound to all true happiness?
Pray God you do not. Good-night,
my darling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV</h2>


<p><i>February 23.</i> After you were gone I
fled to my room, crawling under the window-seat,
much as a mortally wounded
animal tries to hide itself. Here my father
found me many hours later, speechless
and shivering. He drew me from
my retreat, and I still remember the sting
of the brandy as he poured it down my
throat. Afterwards the doctor came, to
do nothing; but all that night my father
sat beside me, and towards morning he
broke down my silence, and we talked
together over the light which had gone
out of our lives, till I fell asleep. He
told me that the death of your two aunts
had made you a great heiress, and rendered
your continuance with us, in our
poverty, impossible. "She's gone away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
out of our class, Donald," my father said
sadly, "and in the change of circumstances
her mother wouldn't have made
me her guardian. It was better for all
of us to let her uncle take her back to
New York." Even in my own grief I
felt his sorrow, and though he did not
dodge my questions, I could see how the
subject pained him, and avoided it thenceforth.
How strangely altered my life
would have been if I had insisted on knowing
more!</p>

<p>The doctor came several times afterwards,
for I did not rally as I should have
done, and at last he ordered a year's cessation
of studies and plenty of exercise.
It was a terrible blow to me at the time,
for I was on the point of entering the
University of Leipzig; but now I can
see it was all for the best, since the time
given to our tours through Spain and
Italy was well spent, and the delay made
me better able to get the full value of
the lectures. Moreover, that outdoor life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
added three inches to the height and seventeen
pounds to the weight of the hitherto
puny boy. For a time my father made
my health his care, and insisted on my
walking and fencing daily; but after that
long holiday he need not have given it a
thought, for I grew steadily to my present
height, and while always of slender
build, I can outwalk or outwork many a
stockier man.</p>

<p>My university career was successful;
it could hardly have failed to be, with
my training. I fear that I became over-elated
with my success, not appreciating
how much it was due to my father's aid
and to the kindness of two of my instructors.
For my Ph. D. I made a study of
the great race movements of the world,
in which my predilection for philology,
ethnology, and history gave me an especial
interest. I so delighted my professor
of philology by my enthusiasm and tirelessness
that he stole long hours from the
darling of his heart to aid me. (I need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
hardly add that I do not allude to Frau
Jastrow, but to his Verb-Roots of Fifty-Two
Languages and Dialects of Indo-Germanic
Origin, to be published some
day in seventeen volumes, quarto.) He
even brought me bundles of his manuscript
to read and criticise. Our relations
were as intimate as were possible
between a professor and a student, and
despite his reputation for ill temper the
only evidence he ever gave me of it was
a certain querulousness over the gaps in
human knowledge.</p>

<p>My doctor's thesis on A Study of the
Influence of Religion in the Alienation
and Mixture of Races&mdash;which, with a
vanity I now laugh over, I submitted not
merely in Latin, but as an original work
in four other languages&mdash;was not only
the delight of both my dear professors,
but was well considered outside the university.
At Jastrow's urging, poor Buchholtz
printed editions in all five languages;
and as only the German had any sale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
worth mentioning, he ever after looked
gloomy at a mere allusion to the title.
But though it earned me no royalties, it
won me the Kellermann prize, given every
fifth year for the best original work on an
historical subject.</p>

<p>On our first arrival in Leipzig my father
sought literary employment from the
great publishers of that city of books,
and soon obtained all the "review" and
"hack" writing that he wished. He encouraged
me to help him in the work,
and in my training probably lay his chief
inducement, for he was paid at starvation
rates in that land of hungry authors.
The labor quickly taught me the technical
part of authorship, the rock which
has wrecked so many hopes. Our work
brought us, too, the acquaintance of many
literary men, and thus gave us our pleasantest
society, and one peculiarly fitted
to develop me. Furthermore, we secured
command of the unlimited books stored
on the publishers' shelves, which we used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
as freely as if they were our own private
library.</p>

<p>Very quickly I began to do more than
help my father in his work; I myself
tried to write. He put many a manuscript
in the fire, after going over the
faults with me, but finally I wrote something
that he let me send to an editor.
His admirable judgment must have been
warped by his fatherly love, for the article
was rejected. A like fate befell many
others, but at last one was accepted, and
I do not know which of us was the more
delighted when it was published in the
"Zeitschrift für Deutsche Philologie."
By my father's advice it was signed with
a pseudonym; for he pointed out that I
was still too young for editors who knew
me to give my manuscript a reading, and
that a German name would command
greater respect from them than an English
one.</p>

<p>I received twenty marks for that first
article, and spent it in secret the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43.png---Kuninga" id="Page_43.png---Kuninga">[Pg 43.png---Kuninga]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
day. Had you known of my pleasure in
the gift, and the hopes that went with
it, I think you would have sent a line of
acknowledgment to the hungry-hearted
fellow who, after four years of separation,
still longed for a token from you.
Three times had I written, without response,
but I thought the beauty of the
photograph would so appeal to you that
it must bring me back a word from you,
and lived in the hope for six months.
My father joked me genially about what
I had done with that vast wealth, pretending
at moments that he believed it
had been avariciously hoarded, and at
other times that it had been squandered
in riotous living, till one day, when all
hope of acknowledgment had died, his
chaff wrung from me an exclamation of
pain, suppressed too late to be concealed
from him. So closely attuned had we
become that he understood in an instant
what it meant, and, laying his hand on
my shoulder, he appealed, "Forgive me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
my boy! I have been very cruel in my
thoughtlessness!"</p>

<p>Nothing more was said then, but later
that evening, when we rose from our
work, he asked, "She never replied?"
and when I shook my head, the saddest
look I ever saw in him came upon his
face. He seemed about to speak impulsively,
faltered, checked himself, and
finally entreated, "Bear up, Donald, and
try to forget her." I could only shake my
head again, but he understood. "She's
feminine quicksilver," he groaned, "and
I can't get the dear girl out of my blood,
either." We gripped each other's hands
for a moment, and I said, "Good-night,
father," and he replied, "God help you,
my boy." How happy we should have
been could we have bidden you, "Good-night,
Maizie!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45.png---Kuninga" id="Page_45.png---Kuninga">[Pg 45.png---Kuninga]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V</h2>


<p><i>February 24.</i> I cannot clearly fix the
time when first I decided upon a life of
letters, and presume it was my father's
influence which determined me. After
the publication of my first article, all the
time I could spare from my studies was
devoted to writing. Most of it was magazine
work, but two text-books were more
ambitious flights. Undertaken at my father's
suggestion, the books were revised
by him, till they should have been published
with his name, and not my pseudonym,
on the title-page. This I urged,
but he would not hear of it, insisting that
his work was trivial compared with mine.
I understand his motive now, and see how
wise and loving he was in all his plans.
Thanks to his skill in clarifying knowledge
and fitting it to the immature mind, both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
books attained a large sale almost immediately
on their publication.</p>

<p>My father's abnegation went further,
and occasioned the only quarrel we ever
had. After the publication of several
of my articles, in reading the Deutsche
Rundschau I found an interesting critique
signed with the name I had adopted
as a pseudonym. I laughingly called my
father's attention to it, yet really feeling
a little sore that the credit of my work
should go to another, for the first literary
offspring are very dear to an author's
heart. From that time I was constantly
meeting with the name, but stupidly
failed to recognize my father's brilliant,
luminous touch till the publication of
another article of my writing revealed the
truth to me; for at the end of this I
found again my pseudonym, though I had
signed my own name. On my sending
an indignant letter to the editor, he returned
me the revised proof of my article,
at the bottom of which "Donald Mait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>land"
was struck out, and "Rudolph
Hartzmann" substituted. My father had
made the change in the last revision, and
had returned the sheets without letting
me see them.</p>

<p>In a moment the veil was gone from my
eyes, and, grieved and angry, I charged
him with the deception. I do not like to
think of what I said or of the gentleness
with which he took it. The next day,
when I was cooler, he pleaded with me to
let him continue signing the name to his
articles; but I insisted that I would not
permit the double use, and the only concession
he could win from me was that I
would still keep the name provided he
refrained from using it again. How could
I resist his "Don, I never asked anything
but this of you. I am an old man with
no possibility of a career. You are all I
have to love or work for in this world.
Let me try to help you gain a name."
Oh, father, if I had only understood, I
would not have been so cruel as to deny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
your request, but would have sacrificed
my own honesty and allowed the lie rather
than have refused what now I know to
have been so dear a wish. I even resented
what I thought a foolish joke of his, when
he registered us constantly at hotels as
"Rudolph Hartzmann and father." It is
poetic justice that in time I should stoop
to so much greater dishonesty than that
which I was intolerant of in him.</p>

<p>Owing as much to his articles as to
those I subsequently wrote, my pseudonym
became a recognized one in the
world of letters, and my work soon commanded
a good price. Furthermore, considerable
interest was excited as to the
author. There is a keen delight in anonymous
publication, for one does not get the
one-sided chatter that acknowledged authors
receive, and often I have sat in the
midst of a group of littérateurs and scholars
and heard my articles talked over. I

it, of course,&mdash;and can remem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>ber
the way my father hid his laughter
when a member of the party said, "Maitland,
you ought to write an article refuting
Hartzmann, for you've got the knowledge
to do it." It amuses me to think how vain
and elated I became over what now I see
was only 'prentice work. I am glad you
did not know me in those years of petty
victory, and that before we met I had
been saddened and humbled.</p>

<p>Some one at Mr. Whitely's dinner, this
winter, asked what was a sufficient income,
and you, Maizie, gravely answered,
"A little more than one has," which made
us all laugh. If you had not been the
quicker and the wittier, and thus forestalled
me, I should have said, "Enough to
satisfy the few or many wishes each person
creates within himself which money
can satisfy." Thanks to my prize, my
writings, and the profits of my text-books,
I obtained this. In fact, the three so
lengthened my purse that I fancy few
millionaires have ever felt so truly rich;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
for I was enabled to gratify my greatest
wish. In our visits to Spain, Italy, and
Constantinople, I had garnered all that
I could find bearing on the two great
race movements of the Moors and Turks,
which so changed the world's history;
but I had discovered that I needed more
than the documentary materials to write
clearly of them. I longed to go to their
source, and then follow the channels along
which those racial floods had rushed, till,
encountering the steel armor and gunpowder
of Europe, they had dashed in
scattered spray, never to gather force
again. In my eagerness I had been for
making the attempt before, but my father
had urged our limited means and the
shortness of my university vacations as
bars to my wishes. My degree removed
the one objection, and my earnings and
prize the other. Few persons would care
to undertake the travel we planned with
the pittance we had earned, but it was
enough for us. How fortunate it is for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
me that my student life and travels trained
me to absolute self-denial and frugality!
Otherwise these last three years of closest
economy and niggardliness would have
been hard to bear.</p>

<p>By the influence of Professor Humzel,
working first through his former pupil,
Baron Weiseman, secondly through Giers,
and thirdly through I know not whom,
we secured permission to join a Russian
surveying party, and thus safely and expeditiously
reached the mountains of the
Altai range. We did not stay with the
party after they began their work, but
assuming native dress we turned southward;
plunging instantly among the medley
of peoples and tongues which actually
realizes the mythical Babel. Turkish,
Hebrew, Arabic, and Sanskrit I had mastered
in varying degrees, and they were
an "open sesame" to the dialects we
encountered, while the hot sun and open-air
life soon colored us so deeply that we
passed for men of a distant but not alien<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
race. Following nature's routes, once
man's only paths, we wandered leisurely:
to Tashkend on horseback, to Bokhara on
foot, by boat down the Amoo to Khiva,
and on to Teheran, then by caravan to
Bagdad, up the Euphrates, gradually
working through Asia Minor. Stopping
at Smyrna for a brief rest, we took boat
to Cyprus, from thence crossed to Damascus,
and from Jerusalem traveled along
the caravan route to Mecca. Passing
over the Red Sea to Egypt, we skirted
the south coast of the Mediterranean, till
we reached the Pillars of Hercules.</p>

<p>You ought to have made that pilgrimage.
In speaking of my book you expressed
the wish that you might make
such a trip, and those years would have
been as great a playtime to you as to
us. You could have borne the exposure,
rough though the life was, and it would
have been as compound oxygen to your
brave and venturesome nature. I confess
I do not like to think of that dazzlingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
pure skin burned to any such blackness
as I saw in my mirror on reaching the
end of our journeyings; for truly no better
Arab in verisimilitude strolled about
the native quarter of Tangier in May,
1886, than Donald Maitland.</p>

<p>My long study of those older races and
three years' life spent among them have
not made me accept their dogma of fatalism,
yet I must believe that something
stronger than chance produced our meeting
in that Moorish town. Down streams,
over mountains, and across deserts, seas,
and oceans, our paths had converged; on
foot, mounted, by rail or boat, we came
together as if some hidden magnet were
drawing us both. A thousand chances
were against our meeting, even when we
were in the same town; for you were
housed in the best hotel, while we lodged
in a little Jewish place in the Berber
quarter. In another day my father and
I should have crossed to Spain, without
so much as a visit to the European sec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>tion.
But for that meeting I should have
returned to Leipzig, and passed a contented
life as a Herr Doctor and Professor;
for though my heart was still
warm with love of you, it had been denied
and starved too long to have the
strength to draw me from the path my
head had marked out. Yet I would not
now accept the unemotional and peaceful
career I had planned in lieu of my present
life; for if my love is without hope,
it is still love, and though you turned
me away from your door with far less
courtesy than you would shut out a beggar,
yet I am near you and see you constantly,
and that is worth more to me
than peace. Good-night, my love. God
bless you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p><i>February 25.</i> It was thought of you
which led to our meeting. After the
evening meal of dried salt fish, pancakes,
dates, and coffee, my father and I wandered
out to the Sok, and, as was our
wont, sat down among the people. Refusing
the hasheesh water and sweetmeats
which the venders urged upon us,
"to make you dream of your love joyfully,"
we listened to the story-tellers and
the singers. Some one with a fine natural
voice sang presently an Arabic love-song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My love, so lovely yet so cruel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why came you so to torture me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could I but know the being who<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has caused you thus to hate me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once I saw and gazed upon your lovely form each hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now you ever shun me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still each night you come in dreams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For me to ask, Who sent you?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your answer is, Him whom I love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you bid me then forget my passion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I reply, If it was not for love, how could the world go on?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was a song I had heard and loved in
many lands and many dialects, but that
night it stirred me deeply, and brought
to mind your image, ever dear. I sat
and dreamed of you till the farrago about
me became unbearable; and whispering
a word to my father, I rose and strode
away, with a yearning truly mastering. I
could have had no thought that you were
near, for when we stood far closer I was
still unconscious of your presence. But
if not an intuition, I ask what could it
be?</p>

<p>Wandering through the narrow streets
without purpose or goal, I presently saw
looming above me the great hill on which
stands the Alcassaba. Climbing in the
brilliant moonlight up the steep and ill-conditioned
road, and passing that jumble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail" id="Page_57.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail">[Pg 57.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
of buildings upon which so many races
and generations have left their impress,
I strolled along the wall to a ruined embrasure
at the corner overlooking the sea.
How long I stood there leaning upon the
parapet I do not know. Not till you were
close upon me was I conscious that my
solitude was ended.</p>

<p>I heard footsteps, but was too incurious
to turn and glance at the intruders.
Nay, more, when that harsh, strident,
American voice demanded, "There, isn't
that great?" I felt so irritated by both
tone and words that but for the seeming
rudeness I should have moved away
at once. You spoke so low I could not
hear your reply, and I wonder what you
said,&mdash;for his "great" applied to such
beauty must have rasped much more
on your artistic sense than it did on
mine.</p>

<p>"And this black fellow in the turban
standing here," continued the strident
voice, "he fits, too, like the paper on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail" id="Page_58.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail">[Pg 58.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
wall, though probably he's a sentry taking
forty winks on the sly. It makes an
American mad to see how slack things
are run over here."</p>

<p>I heard a gentle "Hush," and then a
murmur as you went on speaking.</p>

<p>"None of these black fellows speak
English," came the self-assured voice
again. Then, though I could have heard
his natural tone full fifty feet away, the
man called much louder: "Hey! what's
the name of that point out there?"</p>

<p>I should have chosen to make no answer;
but remembering the courtesy and
dignity of the race I was impersonating,
I replied without turning, "Cape Spartel."</p>

<p>You must have said something, for a
moment later he laughed, saying, "Not
a bit of it. Now see me jolly him up."
I heard footsteps, and then some one
leaned against the parapet, close beside
me. "Backsheesh," he intimated, and
jingled some coins in his pocket.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>I stood silent, so he tapped me on the
shoulder and asked, "Are you one of
the palace guards?" Unsuppressed by
my monosyllabic "No," he persisted by
saying, "What's your business, then?"
jingling his coins again. "Stop pulling
me, Mai," he added, as an aside.</p>

<p>"I am a stranger in Tangier," I answered
quietly.</p>

<p>"From whereabouts?" he questioned.</p>

<p>"The East."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're one of the wise men, are
you?" he observed jocosely. "Are you
a Jew or a Mohammedan?"</p>

<p>"Not the latter, fortunately for you."</p>

<p>"And why fortunately?" he nagged.</p>

<p>"Because a true believer would have
taken the question as a deadly insult."</p>

<p>"They'd be welcome," he laughed,
"though it is rather irritating to be mistaken
for a Jew. I shouldn't like it myself."</p>

<p>I thought of the dignified Jew traders
who had made part of our caravan in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail" id="Page_60.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail">[Pg 60.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
journey from Bagdad to Damascus, and
answered, "There is little danger of
that."</p>

<p>"I guess not," he assented. "But if
you aren't a Jew or a Mohammedan, what
are you?"</p>

<p>He had spoiled my mood, and since it
was gone I thought I would amuse myself
with the man. "A seeker of knowledge
from the Altai Mountains," I responded.</p>

<p>"Never heard of them," he announced;
"or is it your Choctaw for those?" he
added, pointing towards the dark masses
of the Atlas Mountains.</p>

<p>I smiled and answered, "They are
many moons' travel from here."</p>

<p>"Oh!" he exclaimed. "How did you
happen to come?"</p>

<p>"To follow after those gone before."</p>

<p>"I see," he said. "Relatives, I suppose?
Hope you found them well?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied, carrying on the humor,
"dying."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>He jingled his coins, and asked, "Anything
to be done for them?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"What's the complaint?"</p>

<p>"Civilization in the abstract, repeating
rifles and rapid-firing guns in the concrete."</p>

<p>"Eh!" he ejaculated.</p>

<p>Then the lowest and sweetest of voices
said, "Won't you tell us what you
mean?"</p>

<p>Was it my irritation that the man before
me, rather than the subtler-passioned
people I knew so well, was the dominant
type of the moment, or was it the sympathy
your voice stirred within me, which
made me speak? In a moment I was
sketching broadly the inhumanity of this
thing we call Christian civilization, which,
more grasping than the Inquisition, has
overrun the world, tearing the lands from
their owners, and, not content with this
spoliation, demands of its victims that
they shall give up the customs of many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
centuries' evolution, and conform to habits,
governments, and religions which their
very instincts make impossible; and because
they cannot change, but break out,
these believers in the golden rule shoot
them down. I protested at the mockery
of calling civilized a world held at peace
by constant slaughter, or of styling the
national Jack Ketches of humanity Christian
nations! I protested against the
right of one man to hold another barbaric
because he will not welcome his master,
greet with joy the bands of steel we call
railroads, and crush his nature within the
walls of vast factories, to make himself
the threefold slave of society, government,
and employer. And finally, I gloried
in the fact that though the white
races had found a weapon against the
black and yellow ones which enabled
them to overrun and subjugate, yet nature
had provided nature's people with
the defense of climate,&mdash;a death-line to
the whites; and behind that line the co<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail" id="Page_63.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail">[Pg 63.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>lored
races are unconquerable in the sense
of conquest being extinction. I knew
the other side, that altruistic tenet of political
economy defined in brief as "the
greatest good of the greatest number,"
and in my mind held the even balance of
the historian between the two; but to this
utilitarian, modern, self-satisfied American
I had to urge the rights of races
thousands of years our senior, and far
in advance of us in the knowledge and
amenities that make life worth the most.</p>

<p>You both were silent till I ended; but
I had best left unspoken what your companion
could not understand, for when
I finished he inquired, "What mountains
did you say you came from?" And
when I told him, he added laughingly,
"You must have some pretty good stump
speaking in your elections."</p>

<p>"We are very grateful for your explanation,"
you thanked me gently.</p>

<p>"Never been in America?" he surmised;
and except for you I should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail" id="Page_64.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail">[Pg 64.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
told him that I was his countryman, it
would have been so adequate a retort to
his inference. But your voice and manner
had made me so ashamed of my earlier
mood that I merely answered, "Yes."</p>

<p>"Humph!" he grunted in surprise;
and as if to prove his incorrigibility he
continued, "Thought your ideas were too
back-number for that."</p>

<p>I could not help laughing, and the moment
my laugh became articulate yours
too overflowed your lips, as a spring
breaks past its edges and falls rippling
over pebbles.</p>

<p>That laugh, so well remembered, revealed
your presence to me. My heart
beat quickly and my head whirled dizzily,
and in my bewilderment I took a step
backward, quite forgetting the embrasure,
till a stone gave way and I felt that I was
falling. Then my consciousness went
from me, and when thought came surging
backward I lay a moment quiet, thinking
it must have been a dream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's coming round all right," I
heard, and at the sound I opened my
eyes. You were leaning over me with
the moonlight shining on your face, and
I caught my breath, you were so beautiful.</p>

<p>"You've given us a scare," continued
the man, on whose knee my head was
resting. "You want to keep your wits
about you better. Pretty poor business
tumbling off walls, but that's what comes
of having ruins. You won't be quite so
cocky in the future about your run-out
races."</p>

<p>I felt his laughter justified, but hardly
heeded it, my thoughts were so engaged.
You were wetting my forehead with
brandy, and I lay there too happy to
speak.</p>

<p>"Now let me raise you a bit higher,"
the man offered kindly, "so you can get
your addled senses back." He lifted me,
and I groaned at the sudden terrible pain
that shot up my leg.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello!" he cried, laying me gently
down. "Something wrong, after all?
What is it?"</p>

<p>"My leg," I moaned.</p>

<p>"Here, Maizie, hold his head, while
I appoint an investigating committee,"
he ordered, and in another moment I
felt your arms about me, and in my joy
at your touch I almost forgot my torture.</p>

<p>"Well, you've broken one of your
walking-sticks," the man informed me,
after a gentler touching of it than I
thought possible to his nature. "Now,
Maizie, if you'll sit and hold his head,
I'll get a litter. You won't mind staying
here alone, will you?"</p>

<p>"It is my wish," you acceded calmly.</p>

<p>"O. K.," he said, rising, and even in
his kindness he could not help but seize
the opportunity to glorify his country.
"If this had happened in New York, Mr.
Altai, we'd have had an ambulance here
five minutes ago! Civilization isn't all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail" id="Page_67.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail">[Pg 67.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
bad, I tell you, as you'd find out if you'd
give it a chance."</p>

<p>The moment he was gone I tried to
speak, and murmured "Maizie;" but you
let me get no further, saying "Hush,"
and putting your hand softly over my
lips. I suppose you thought me merely
repeating the name he had called you,
while I loved your touch too deeply to
resist the hand I longed to kiss. Now I
am glad I did not speak, for if I had it
would have robbed me of my last sweet
moment with you.</p>

<p>Long before I thought it possible, and
far too soon, indeed, despite my suffering,
we heard men approaching. When the
torch-bearers came climbing over the
rocks, my first desire was to see how
much of your beauty was owing to the
moonlight, and my heart leaped with exultation
to find that you were beautiful
even in the livid glare of the torches.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Altai," your companion
remarked, "where shall we take you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and I gave him the name of the hotel. A
moment later, as they lifted me, I again
fainted, but not till I had kissed your
hand. You snatched it away, and did not
hear my weakly whispered "Good-night,
Maizie."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail" id="Page_69.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail">[Pg 69.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p><i>February 26.</i> The setting of my leg,
that night, was so long and exhausting
an operation that after it was done I was
given an opiate. Instead of bringing oblivion
the drug produced a dreamy condition,
in which I was cognizant of nothing
that happened about me, and saw
only your face. I knew I ought to sleep,
and did my best to think of other things;
but try as I might, my thought would
return and dwell upon your beauty.</p>

<p>I have often wished I had been born
an artist, that I might try to paint your
portrait, for words can no more picture
you than they can transmit the fragrance
of a violet. Indeed, to me the only word
which even expresses your charm is "radiant,"
and that to others, who have never
seen you, would suggest little. No real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail" id="Page_70.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail">[Pg 70.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
beauty can be described, for it rests in
nothing that is tangible. In truth, to
speak of your glorious hair, the whiteness
of your brow and throat, the brilliant
softness of your eyes, or the sweetness
yet strength of your tender though unsmiling
lips is to make but a travesty of
description. I have heard painters talk
of your hair and try to convey an idea of
its beauty, but I know it too well even to
make the attempt. When we were gazing
at the rainbow, last autumn, and you
said that if its tints could be transferred
to a palette you believed it would be possible
to paint anything, I could not help
correcting, "Except your hair." You
laughed, and declared, "I did not know
you ever made that kind of a speech!"
whereupon Agnes cried, "Didn't I ever
tell you, Maizie, the compliment the doctor
paid you last winter?" I thought she
was alluding to my retort when my mother
asserted that your eyes were so
large and lustrous that, to her, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
"positively loud." Indignant at such a
remark, Agnes had appealed to me to
deny it. Not caring to treat the malicious
speech seriously, I had answered
that I could not agree, though I had
sometimes thought your eyes "too dressy
for the daytime,"&mdash;a joke I have heard
so often quoted that it is apparently in
a measure descriptive, yet one which
I should have felt mortified at hearing
repeated to you. Fortunately Agnes's
reference was to another remark of mine,
in which, speaking of your mouth, I had
crudely translated a couple of lines from a
Persian poem:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In vain you strive to speak a bitter word&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It meets the sweetness of your lips ere it is heard."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>You were too used to compliments to
be embarrassed when the lines were repeated,
and only looked at me in a puzzled
way. I do not wonder you were
surprised at the implied admiration of the
two speeches, after my apparent coldness
and indifference. My behavior must seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail" id="Page_72.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail">[Pg 72.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
to you as full of contradictions as your
beauty is to me. To say your great
attraction is the radiance&mdash;the verve,
spirit, and capacity for enthusiasm&mdash;of
which one cannot fail to be conscious is
to deny the calm dignity with which you
bear yourself, yet both these qualities
belong to you. The world insists that
you are proud and distant, and your face
has the clean-cut features which we associate
with patrician blood, while your
height and figure, and the set and carriage
of your head upon that slender
throat, suggest a goddess. But I, who
understand you so much better than the
world, know that your proud face overlies
the tenderest of natures, and is not an
index, but a mask of feelings you do not
care to show. As for the people who
criticise you most, they would be the last
to do so if they were not conscious of the
very superiority they try to lessen.&mdash;Ah,
how foolish it is to write all this, as if I
needed to convince myself of what I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail" id="Page_73.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail">[Pg 73.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
so well! And even if this were for the
eye of others, to those who know you not
it would be but the extravagant idealism
for which a lover is proverbial.</p>

<p>When I awoke from the sleep my
dreaming had drifted into, my first request
of my father was to find your
whereabouts. He told me that a dragoman
had come that morning to inquire
for me,&mdash;and had left what now he showed
me,&mdash;a great bunch of roses and a basket
of fruit, with the card of "Mr. Foster
G. Blodgett, 547 Fifth Avenue," on the
back of which was written:&mdash;</p>

<p>"With sincere regrets that a previously
formed plan of leaving Tangier this morning
prevents our seeing our courteous instructor
of last night, and with hopes that
he may have a quick and easy recovery
from his accident."</p>

<p>The card was a man's, but the handwriting
was feminine, and the moment
my father turned his back I kissed it.
I was further told that the servant had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail" id="Page_74.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail">[Pg 74.png---rhecespieces_at_gmail]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
asked my name and taken it down, giving
me the instant hope that when you
knew to whom you had been so merciful,
you would even disarrange your plans
to let me have a moment's glimpse of
you. But though I listened all the afternoon
hopefully and expectantly, you
never came. I felt such shyness about you,
I did not speak to my father of your beauty,
and he did not question me at all.</p>

<p>Our native hotel, built in Eastern fashion
about a court, with only blank outside
walls, was no place in which to pass
a long invalidism, and three days later
my father had me carried to the steamer,
and, crossing to Gibraltar, we traveled
by easy railroad trips to Leipzig. We
had left our belongings with Jastrow,
and he begged us, on our arrival, to become
members of his household, which
we were only too glad to do for a time.
His joy over my return was most touching,
and he and Humzel both seemed to
regard me very much as if I were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
creation of their own brains, who was to
bring them immortal fame in time. My
father had long before counseled me to
be a pursuer of knowledge, and not of
money; telling me the winning of the
latter narrowed the intellect and stunted
the finer qualities of one's nature, making
all men natural enemies, while the
acquisition of the former broadened one's
mind, developed the nobility within, and
engendered love of one's associates.
These two men illustrated his theory,
and had my tendency been avaricious I
think their unselfish love and example
would have made me otherwise. And
yet, how dare I claim to be free from
sordidness, when all my thoughts and
hopes and daily life are now bent on
winning money?</p>

<p>My leg was far too troublesome to permit
me to sit at a desk, but my father
insisted on being my scribe; and thus,
lying on a lounge, I began part of the
work I had so long planned, taking up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
for my first book the Turkish irruption,
the crusades against the Saracens, and
their subsequent history. Thinking so
much of you, both as the child who had
won my boyish heart and as the beautiful
woman whose face had fascinated and
moved me so deeply, I do not know how,
except for my work, I should have lived
through those long and weary months of
enforced inaction while my leg so slowly
knit.</p>

<p>More as recreation from this serious
endeavor than as supplementary labor, I
gathered the articles I had written for the
Deutsche Rundshau and the Revue des
Deux Mondes from time to time in our
travels, and with new material from my
journal I worked the whole into a popular
account of what we had seen and done.
While I still used a walking-stick I was
reading proof of the German edition, and
my English replica, rather than translation,
was under negotiation through my
publisher for London and New York<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
editions. My father, who busied himself
with a French version, insisted that the
book would be a great success, and the
articles under my assumed name had
been so well noticed that I was myself
hopeful of what better work in book form
might do for my reputation; for against
his advice, I had determined to abandon
my pseudonym.</p>

<p>But all these schemes and hopes were
forgotten in the illness of my father.
Contrary to my wishes, he had overworked
himself in the French translation,
while his life, for months of my
enforced inactivity, had been one long
service, impossible for me to avoid or
refuse without giving him pain. This
double exertion proved too great a strain.
The day after he sent the manuscript to
Paris, as he sat conning the sheets of the
concluding chapter of my history, he laid
them down without a word, and, leaning
forward, quietly rested his head upon the
table. I was by his side and had him on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the sofa in an instant, where he lay unconscious
till the doctor came. We were
told that it was a slight stroke, and by
the next day he seemed quite well. But
slowly he lost the use of one side, and
within a week was helpless. I like to remember
that I was well enough to tend
him as he had tended me. He lingered
for a month, sweet and gentle as always;
then, one evening, as I sat beside him,
he opened his eyes and said, "Good-night,
Don. Good-night, Maizie." And
with those words his loving soul went
back to its Creator.</p>

<p>I found about his neck a ribbon to
which was attached a locket containing
the long tress you cut off for him that
day in the Bois, one of my mother's
curls, and a little tow-colored lock which
I suppose was my own hair before it
darkened,&mdash;a locket I have since worn
unchanged, because, sadly discordant
though such association has become, I
cannot bring myself to separate what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
tied together. It seems to symbolize his
love for all of us.</p>

<p>The kindness of my friends I can
never forget. I was so broken down as
really to be unfit for thought, and their
generous foresight did everything possible
to spare me trouble or pain. Especially
to Professor and Frau Jastrow
do I owe an unpayable debt, for they
made me feel that there was still some
one in whose love I stood first; and had
I been the child who had never come to
them, I question if they could have done
more for me than they did.</p>

<p>One thing that I had to do myself was
to notify my mother of my father's death.
From the time she had quitted us my
father and I had avoided mention of her;
but during his illness he asked me to
write in case of his death, and gave me
her New York address, from which I inferred
that in some way he had kept
himself informed concerning her, though
I feel very certain that she had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
written him. That I had never tried to
learn anything myself was due to the estrangement,
but still more to my interest
in my studies and work. Now I wrote
her, as I had promised, telling her briefly
the circumstances of my father's illness
and death, and offering to write fuller
details if she wished to know them. I
would not feign love for her, but I wrote
tenderly of him and without coldness to
her. She never replied.</p>

<p>Kind as were all my intimates, I craved
more than friendship, however loving it
might be. One of the two great loves
of my life had gone out from it, and, in
the gap it left, the other became doubly
dear to me. The wish to see you grew
and strengthened each day, until at last
it shaped my plans, and I announced my
intention to visit America; making the
specious explanation that, after my long
invalidism and grief, the change would be
the best specific for me.</p>

<p>At this time I received the offer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
appointment as professor extraordinarius
of philology and ethnology under Jastrow,
another manifestation of his love;
but till I had seen you I would not bind
myself by accepting, and through his influence
I was given three months to consider
my answer. I seem doomed never
to requite the services of those I love
the most, but I am glad that in the nine
months which I passed under his roof
my knowledge of the Eastern dialects
had pushed his work so much nearer
completion.</p>

<p>Leaving all my possessions behind
except the manuscript of my history, I
started on my voyage of love. For two
days I tarried in Paris, settling my little
property. I had long known that the
flotsam of my father's fortune, wrecked
in Wall Street, was a few bonds deposited
with Paris bankers; and when I
called upon the firm it was merely to
continue the old arrangement, by which
they cut the coupons and placed them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
to my bank credit. It was in this visit
that I searched out our old pension, and
sat dreaming in the park. How could
I imagine, remembering those days of
closest love and sympathy, and knowing
too your kindness to one you thought
a mere Eastern stroller, that you could
have changed so to your former friend?</p>

<p>The most curious fact to me, in looking
back upon that time, is that the idea
never occurred to me that you were a
married woman. It never entered my
thoughts that a beauty which fascinated
and drew me so far from my natural orbit
must be an equally powerful charm to
other men. As for Mr. Blodgett, I never
gave him a second thought, not even accounting
for his relations with you. My
foolishness, I suppose, is typical of the
scholar's abstraction and impracticality.</p>

<p>As the steamer neared New York, my
impatience to see you increased apace.
Far from longing for our old ten-day
passage, I found a voyage of seven days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
too long. Ridiculous as it may seem, I
almost lost my temper at the slowness
of the customs examination. I believe I
was half mad, and only marvel that I did
so sane a thing as to go to a hotel, change
my clothes, and dine, before attempting
to see you.</p>

<p>I ascertained Mr. Walton's address the
moment I reached my hotel, and sent a
messenger there to inquire your whereabouts.
He brought me back word that
Mr. Walton was absent from the city,
but the servant had informed him that
you still lived with your uncle and that
you were in town.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you the surprise and joy
I felt when, on arriving at your house
on Madison Avenue that evening, I discovered
it to be our old habitat. It
seemed as if your selection of that as
your home, probably from sentiment,
was a bow of promise for the future, and
I rang the bell, almost trembling with
emotion and happiness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>The footman showed me to the drawing-room
and took my card. All inside,
so far as I could see, was changed past
the point of recognition, but everything
was beautiful, and I felt in that one room
that no decorator's conventional taste had
formed its harmony, but that an artistic
sense had planned the whole. What a
contrast it was to the old days of untasteful
and untidy richness!</p>

<p>I sat but a moment before the footman
returned. Looking not at me, but over
my head, and with an attitude and air
as deferential as if I were the guest of
all others most welcome, he said, "Miss
Walton declines the honor of Mr. Maitland's
acquaintance, and begs to be excused."</p>

<p>The blow came so suddenly, and was
so crushing, that for a moment I lost my
dignity. "There must be some mistake!"
I exclaimed. "You gave Miss
Walton my card?"</p>

<p>The footman only bowed assent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go to Miss Walton and say I must
see her a moment."</p>

<p>"Miss Walton instructed me to add,
in case Mr. Maitland persisted, that she
prefers to hold no intercourse with Mr.
Maitland and will receive no messages
from him."</p>

<p>Pride came to my rescue, and I passed
silently into the hall. The servant
opened the door, and I went out from
my old home, never to enter it more.
At the foot of the steps I turned and
looked back, hardly yet believing what I
had been told. Even in the sting and
humiliation of that moment my love was
stronger than the newer sensations. I
said, "Good-night, Maizie. God keep
you," and walked away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII</h2>


<p><i>February 27.</i> I sat for hours in my
room, that night, trying to find some
solution of the mystery and groping for
a future course of action. I thought of
a visit to my mother, on the chance that
she would give me the key to the puzzle,
but could not bring myself to it. Rejecting
that idea, I decided to seek out Mr.
Blodgett, who, being your friend, might
know the reason for what you had done.</p>

<p>Finding on inquiry, the next morning,
that Mr. Blodgett was a member of one
of the chief banking firms of New York,
I went to his office. The ante-room was
well filled with people anxious to see the
great banker, and the door-boy refused me
access to him without giving my name
and business. Knowing that "Donald
Maitland" would mean nothing to Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Blodgett, and might even fail to secure
me an audience, I wrote on a slip of
paper, "A seeker of knowledge from the
Altai Mountains." Nor was I wrong, for
the boy, on his return, gave me immediate
entrance, and another moment brought
me face to face with my once-disliked
countryman.</p>

<p>His hand was extended to greet
me, but as he looked at my face his
arm dropped in surprise. "Your name,
please?" he demanded, with a business-like
clip to his voice, at the same time
picking up and glancing quickly at three
or four cards and slips of paper that were
on the corner of his desk.</p>

<p>"I am the attorney for ancient peoples,"
I announced, smiling, "come to
thank the New World for its kindness to
a broken-legged man."</p>

<p>Instantly Mr. Blodgett smiled too, and
again extended his hand. "Glad to see
you," he said. "Sit down." Then looking
at me keenly, he added, "You've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
done a lot of bleaching or scrubbing since
we met."</p>

<p>"In the interval my face has been hidden
from the sun-god of my fathers."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Then his Americanism cropped
out by a question: "Are you European
or Asiatic?&mdash;for you are too dark to be
the one, and too white to be the other."</p>

<p>"My parents were American, and I
was born in New York."</p>

<p>"The deuce you were! Then why
were you masquerading in Arab dress
and with a brown face in Tangier, and
why did you say you came from some
mountains in Asia?"</p>

<p>"I was for the time an Arab, and I
was last from the Altai Mountains," I
explained, and smilingly added, "Is my
explanation satisfactory?"</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose you spoke by the
book," he replied. "Wherever you were
born, I'm glad to see&mdash;Hold on!"
he cried, interrupting his own speech.
"Why did you call yourself Dr. Rudolph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
Hartzmann, of Leipzig, if you were an
American?"</p>

<p>"I did not," I denied, startled by his
question, for my identity with the pseudonym
was known only to my professors
and publishers.</p>

<p>"You weren't living in Tangier under
the name of Hartzmann?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then how came it that when my
servant was sent to leave some fruit and
flowers for you and inquire your name,
he was told that you were Dr. Rudolph
Hartzmann, of Leipzig?"</p>

<p>"Are you serious?" I questioned, as
much puzzled as he for the moment.</p>

<p>"Never more so. I remember our astonishment
to think that any European
should have so dark a skin and live in
the native quarter."</p>

<p>"Mr. Blodgett," I explained, "I did
not know till this moment that a pen
name I have used to sign my writings
had been given you, but it was a joke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
my father's to register me under it, and
my only theory is that he had given some
one in the hotel that name, and, by mischance,
your servant was misinformed."</p>

<p>He was too good a business man to
look as skeptical as he probably felt, and
merely asked, "What is your real name,
then?"</p>

<p>"Donald Maitland, son of William
Maitland."</p>

<p>His eyes gave a startled wink and
he screwed his lips into position for a
whistle, but checking the inclination, he
merely turned his revolving-chair so that
he looked out of a window. He sat thus
for a moment, and then, facing me, he
questioned, with a sudden curtness of
voice and manner, "What is your business
with me?"</p>

<p>"I have taken the liberty of calling on
the supposition that you are a friend of
Miss Walton."</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"Miss Walton was once my father's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
ward, yet last night she refused to see
me. Can you tell me why?"</p>

<p>"The reason is rather obvious," he
asserted crisply.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me what it is?"</p>

<p>He looked at me from under his gray
eyebrows. "Is that all you want of
me?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Miss Walton refused to
see you because she despises you."</p>

<p>I felt my cheeks burn, but I gripped
the arm of my chair and waited till I
could speak coolly; then I asked, "For
what?"</p>

<p>"You are ignorant of the fact that
your father embezzled a part of Miss
Walton's fortune, and that you and he
have since lived upon it?" he exclaimed,
with no veiling of his contempt.</p>

<p>I sat calmly, for the idea was too new,
and I had too many connecting links to
recall, to have the full horror of the disgrace
come home to me at once. He did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
not give me time for thought, but interrogated,
"Well?"</p>

<p>Having to speak, I asked, "You are
sure of what you say?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" he ejaculated. "Why, it's
been known to every one for years, and
I was one of the trustees appointed by
the court to look out for Miss Walton's
interest in what property your father
couldn't take with him!"</p>

<p>"If you are a trustee of Miss Walton,"
I said, growing cool in my agony of
shame, "can you spare me five minutes
and answer some questions?"</p>

<p>That I did not deny knowledge of the
wrong seemed to raise me in his opinion,
for he nodded his head and looked less
stern.</p>

<p>"How much did my father&mdash;How
much did Miss Walton lose?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"One hundred and thirty thousand
was all the property he could negotiate,
and we succeeded, by bidding in his
house over the mortgage and by taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the library at a valuation, in recovering
twenty-six thousand."</p>

<p>"Was that amount net?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then in 1879 the amount due Miss
Walton was one hundred and four thousand
dollars?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Blodgett," I added,
rising. "I am only sorry, after your
former kindness, to have given you this
further trouble. I am grateful for both."
In my shame I did not dare to offer him
my hand, but he held out his.</p>

<p>"Mr. Maitland," he rejoined, "I'm a
pretty good judge of men, and I don't
believe you have done wrong knowingly."</p>

<p>"I never dreamed it," I almost sobbed,
shaking his hand.</p>

<p>"It's pretty rough," he said. "I hope
you won't show the white feather by doing
anything desperate?"</p>

<p>I shook my head, and walked to the
door. As I reached it a new thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
occurred to me, and, turning, I asked,
"What has the legal rate of interest been
since 1879?"</p>

<p>For reply he touched an electric button
on his desk, and I heard the lock
click in the door by which I stood. He
pulled a chair near his own, and commanded,
"Come here and sit down," in
such a peremptory tone that I obeyed.
"Why did you ask that question?" he
catechised.</p>

<p>"That I may find out how much I owe
Miss Walton."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"To attempt restitution."</p>

<p>"I hope you know what you're talking
about?"</p>

<p>"I'm still rather confused, but so
much I can see clearly enough."</p>

<p>"How much property have you?"</p>

<p>"My father left me something over
thirty-one thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Thirty-one from one hundred and
four leaves seventy-three."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"And interest," I corrected.</p>

<p>"I thought that was what you were
driving at," he surmised calmly. He
pulled out a volume from its repository
in his desk, and turned backwards and
forwards in the book for a few moments,
taking off figures on a sheet of paper.
"Eight years at five per cent makes the
whole over one hundred and fifty-five
thousand dollars less thirty-one."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"Where can you get the balance?"</p>

<p>"I must earn it."</p>

<p>He looked at me with a slightly quizzical
expression and asked, "How?"</p>

<p>"That I have yet to think out."</p>

<p>"Any business?"</p>

<p>"I have the offer of a professorship at
Leipzig, but that's out of the question
now."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"It would give me only two thousand
a year at first, and the interest on the
debt will be over six thousand annually."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you know?" he questioned.</p>

<p>"Most of the languages and dialects
of Europe and Asia, and a good deal of
history and ethnology. I am fairly read
in arts, sciences, and religions, and I
know something of writing," I answered,
smiling at the absurdity of mentioning
such knowledge in the face of such a
condition.</p>

<p>"Humph! And you'd have sold all
that for two thousand a year?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"Well, that only proves that a man
had better cultivate his gumption, and
not his brains!"</p>

<p>"If he wishes to make money," I could
not help retorting gently.</p>

<p>"You're just like Maizie!" he sniffed,
and his going back to your familiar name
in my presence was the best compliment
he could have paid me. "You two ought
to have died young and gone to heaven,
where there's nothing to do but cultivate
the soul."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish we had!"</p>

<p>"Why don't you go to your mother?"</p>

<p>"For what?"</p>

<p>"For the money."</p>

<p>"Has she money?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She had a little money when
she married your father, which she kept
tight hold of; her mother's death, two
years ago, gave her more, and she has just
married a rich man."</p>

<p>"I don't know yet what I shall do," I
replied, rising.</p>

<p>"Well," he advised kindly, "before you
blow your brains out or do anything else
that's a waste of good material, come and
see me again."</p>

<p>"Thank you," I responded. "And,
Mr. Blodgett, as a favor, I ask that all I
have told you, and even my presence in
New York, shall be confidential between
us."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" he growled. "I shall
tell Maizie all about it."</p>

<p>"Miss Walton least of any," I begged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why don't you insist, too, that Mrs.
Blodgett, who intends that I shall inform
her nightly of everything I know, sha'n't
be told?" he queried.</p>

<p>"It grieves me to be a marplot of
connubial confidences," I rejoined, responding
to his smile, "but this must be
between us."</p>

<p>"Have your own way," he acceded, and
then laughed. "I'll have a good time
over it, for I'll let Mrs. Blodgett see
there is a secret, and she'll go crazy trying
to worm it out of me."</p>

<p>He shook my hand again, and I felt
ashamed to think that his voice and manner
had once made me hold him in contempt.</p>

<p>I went back to the hotel, and thought
over the past, seeing how blind I had
been. Now for the first time everything
became clear. I understood the trip to
Europe and our remaining there, why
my mother had left us, why Mr. Walton
had been permitted to take you from us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
without protest, why we had not mingled
with Americans, and my father's motives
in making me write under a pen name,
in registering me at hotels by it, and in
giving that name to your servant. Now
it was obvious why he never signed his
articles, and why he appealed to me to
let him aid me to make a reputation: it
was his endeavor to atone to me for the
wrong he had done.</p>

<p>Good-night, my love.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX</h2>


<p><i>February 28.</i> Many times in the last
three years I have begun a letter to you,
for the thought that you, like the rest
of the world, may rank my father with
other embezzlers stings me almost to
desperation. Each time it has been to
tear the attempted justification&mdash;or I
should say, extenuation&mdash;into fragments,
long before it was completed. In all
my trials I have come to realize that
nothing I can say can stand him in stead;
for whatever I urge is open to suspicion,
not merely because it is my interest to
condone his act, but still more because it
inevitably becomes an indirect justification
of myself, and therefore, in a sense,
a plea for pardon.</p>

<p>At moments, too, when with you, I
have had to exercise the greatest self<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>-control
not to tell you what I feel. If
I were only some one else than Donald
Maitland, so that I might say to
you:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You should know that your guardian
was incapable of the lowness the world
imputes to him! I am not trying to
belittle the sin, but to distinguish the
motive. His wrong was no mean attempt
to enrich himself at the expense of
one he loved, for his nature was wholly
unmercenary, and his transgression originated,
not through greed, but through
lack of it. Like all men of true intellect,
he was heedless in money matters,
and I am conscious that there was in
him, as there is in me, the certain weakness
which is almost inevitable with mind
cultivation,&mdash;an engulfing, as it were, of
the big principles of right and wrong in
the complexities and the refinements of
cultivated thought. His birthright was
scholarship, but in place of the life he
was fitted for he was forced into Wall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Street, and toiled there without sympathy
or aptitude for his work. Do you
not remember how, aside from our companionship,
his books were his one great
pleasure? The wealth of mind he gave
to us tells the story of how he must have
neglected his office in favor of his library.
Yet though this preference might have
made him a poor man, I cannot think his
studies would ever have led him into dishonesty.
I have never had the heart to
trace the history of his act, but Mr.
Blodgett tells me that shortly after his
marriage he first began to speculate, and
knowing as I do my mother's extravagance
and my father's love for her, I can
understand the motive. The inevitable
result came presently, and, as a temporary
expedient, a small part of your property
was used. Then a desperate attempt
was made to recover this by the risking
of a larger portion, and after that there
was nothing left but confession or flight.
I wish he had spoken, but the weakness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
that produced the first wrong accounts
for the second, and I believe his chief
thought was of me, and how I might be
saved from the consequences of his guilt.
Unless you have put him wholly out of
your heart, you must appreciate that it
was no sordid scheme to cheat you, but a
surrender to the love strong enough to
overcome his honesty. You must know
that he loved you too well to wrong you
willingly, and I think with pain of what
I am sure he must have suffered in his
shame at having robbed you. Do you
not remember the sadness in his face in
those later years, and his tenderness to
both of us? Can you not see that his
kindness, his patience, and his care of us
were his endeavored atonement?"</p>

<p>Oh, Maizie, I ask nothing for myself,
but if you could be brought to think of
him, to love him, as you once did, my
greatest grief would be ended.</p>

<p>Bitter as my misery was after Mr.
Blodgett's revelation, there was still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
some sweetness to make it bearable.
For years I had thought of you as heartless
and forgetful, and even in my love
had hated and despised you at moments,
as only love can hate and despise. The
world thinks that animosity is always
strongest against enemies, though daily
it sees the intensest feuds between those
nations and individuals who are most
closely related, and never learns that the
deepest hatred comes from love. Now
I knew that you had cause for slighting
my letters and gift, and the knowledge
of my injustice and the thought that
you were more lovable than ever were
the silver lining to my cloud of shame.</p>

<p>My first meeting with you was a pure
chance, yet it shaped my life. For three
weeks after my call on Mr. Blodgett I
pondered and vacillated over what I
should do, without reaching any decision.
At the end of that time I went to his
office again.</p>

<p>"Mr. Blodgett has asked two or three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
times if you hadn't called," the boy informed
me; adding, as he opened the
door to the private office, "He told me,
if you ever came again, sir, to show you
right in."</p>

<p>I passed through the doorway, and
then faltered, for you were sitting beside
the banker, overlooking a paper that he
was commenting upon. Could I have
escaped unnoticed, I should have done
so; but you both glanced up as I entered.</p>

<p>The moment you saw me you rose,
with an exclamation of recognition and
surprise, which meant to me that you
knew your old friend in spite of the
changes. Do you wonder that, not foreseeing
what was to come, I stood there
as if turned to stone? My manner evidently
made you question your own eyes,
for you asked, "Is not this Dr. Hartzmann?"</p>

<p>"Of course it is!" cried Mr. Blodgett,
with a quickness and heartiness which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
proved that your question was almost as
great a relief to him as it was to me.</p>

<p>"I did not think, Miss Walton," I replied,
steadying my voice as best I could,
"that you saw my face clearly enough
that evening, to recollect it?"</p>

<p>"The moonlight was so strong," you
explained, "that I should have known
you anywhere."</p>

<p>"Then your eyes are better than
mine," asserted Mr. Blodgett. "I accused
the doctor of using blondine, to
atone for my not recognizing him, though
I must confess he will have to use a good
deal more if he wants to be thought anything
but Italian."</p>

<p>"Then you have met before?" you
questioned.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mr. Blodgett. "I was
going to tell you when we got through
with that mortgage. I knew you would
be interested to hear that the doctor was
in New York. Seems like Tangier, doesn't
it?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"In reminiscence," I assented, merely
to gain time.</p>

<p>"None of your rickety ruins," chuckled
Mr. Blodgett.</p>

<p>"But more ruin," you said.</p>

<p>"And more danger," I added, pointing
out of the window at the passers-by in
Wall Street. "Nowhere in my travels,
even among races that have to go armed,
have I ever seen so many anxious and
careworn faces."</p>

<p>"Most of them look worried," suggested
Mr. Blodgett, "only because they
are afraid they'll take more than three
minutes to eat their lunch."</p>

<p>For a moment you spoke with Mr.
Blodgett on business, and then offered
me your hand in farewell, saying, "I am
very glad, Dr. Hartzmann, for this chance
reunion. Mr. Blodgett and I have often
spoken of the mysterious Oriental who
fell in&mdash;and out&mdash;of our knowledge so
strangely."</p>

<p>"I have wished to meet you, Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Walton," I responded warmly, "to thank
you for your kindness and help to me
when"&mdash;</p>

<p>"That was nothing, Dr. Hartzmann,"
you interrupted, in evident deprecation
of my thanks. "Indeed, I have always
felt that we were in a measure responsible
for your accident, and that we made
but a poor return by the little we did.
Good-morning."</p>

<p>Mr. Blodgett took you to your carriage,
and when he returned he gave a
whistle. "Well!" he exclaimed. "I
haven't gone through such a ten-second
scare since I proposed to my superior
moiety."</p>

<p>"I ought"&mdash;I began.</p>

<p>But he went on: "There's nothing
frightens me so much as a wrought-up
woman. Dynamite or volcanoes aren't
a circumstance to her, because they have
limits; but woman!"</p>

<p>I laughed and said, "The Hindoos
have a paradox to the effect that women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
fear mice, mice fear men, and men fear
women."</p>

<p>"She got so much better and longer
look at you in Tangier than I did that I
don't wonder she recognized Dr. Hartzmann
when I didn't. But why did she
stop there in her recollections?"</p>

<p>"It appeared incomprehensible to me
for a moment, yet, as a fact, her knowing
me as Donald Maitland would have
been the greater marvel of the two.
When she knew me, I was an undersized,
pallid, stooping lad of seventeen.
In the ten years since, my hair and skin
have both darkened greatly, I have grown
a mustache, and my voice has undergone
the change that comes with manhood, as
well as that which comes by speaking
foreign tongues. Your very question as
to whether I was of Eastern birth tells
the whole story, for such a doubt would
seem absurd to one who remembered the
boy of ten years ago. Then, too, Miss
Walton, having recognized me as Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Hartzmann, was, as it were, disarmed of
all suspicion by having no question-mark
in her mind as to my exact identity."</p>

<p>Mr. Blodgett nodded his head in assent.
"And you don't know it all," he
informed me. "I'm going to be frank,
doctor, and acknowledge that I've expressed
a pretty low opinion of you to
her more than once. If Maizie were
asked what man in this world she'd be
least likely to meet in my office on a
friendly footing, she would probably
think of you. Your presence here was
equivalent to saying that you weren't
Donald Maitland, let alone the fact that
I greeted you as Dr. Hartzmann, and
that she could never dream of my having
a reason to deceive her in your identity."</p>

<p>"Such a chain of circumstances almost
makes one believe in kismet," I sighed.
Then I laughed, and added, "How easy
it is to show that one need not be scared&mdash;after
the danger is all over!"</p>

<p>"That isn't the only scare I owe to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
you," muttered Mr. Blodgett. "I didn't
take your address because I told you to
come again. Why didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I am here."</p>

<p>"Yes. But for three weeks I've been
worrying over what you were doing with
yourself, and not knowing that you hadn't
cut your throat."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to have troubled you. I
stayed away to save troubling you."</p>

<p>"You're as considerate as the Fiji
islander was of the missionary, when he
asked him if he had rather be cooked
<i>à la maître d'hôtel</i> or <i>en papillote</i>. What
have you been doing?"</p>

<p>"Very little to any purpose. I have
written to my publisher, offering to sell
my rights in my text-books; to a friend,
asking him to learn for what price he
can sell my library; and to my bankers,
directing them to send me the bonds
and a draft for my balance. I received
the securities and a bill of exchange yesterday,
and am so ignorant of business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
methods that I came to you this morning
to learn how to turn them into cash."</p>

<p>"I'll do better than that," volunteered
Mr. Blodgett, touching a button. "Give
them to me, and I'll have it done."
Then, after he had turned the matter
over to a clerk, he asked, "What does
your publisher offer?"</p>

<p>"Thirty-five hundred."</p>

<p>"And what are your royalties?"</p>

<p>"Last year they were over six hundred
dollars."</p>

<p>"Humph! That's equivalent to investing
money at eighteen per cent.
You ought to get more than that."</p>

<p>"A little more or less is nothing compared
with paying so much on my debt."</p>

<p>"What will your library bring?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps four thousand, if I can find
some one who wants so technical a collection."</p>

<p>"And you can get along without it?"</p>

<p>"I must," I declared, though wincing
a little.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rather goes against the grain, eh?"
he rejoined kindly.</p>

<p>I tried to laugh, and said, "My books
have been such good comrades that I
haven't quite accustomed myself yet to
thinking of them as merchandise. I feel
a little as the bankrupt planter must
have felt when he saw his slave children
offered for sale."</p>

<p>"And what do you plan to do with
yourself?"</p>

<p>"I haven't been able to make up my
mind."</p>

<p>We were interrupted at this point by
some business matter, and I took my
leave. The next morning Mr. Blodgett
called at my boarding-place on his way
down town.</p>

<p>"I haven't come to talk business," he
announced. "I told my wife and daughter,
last night, about the fellow from the
backwoods of Asia, and made them so
curious that Mrs. Blodgett has given me
permission to furnish him board and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
lodgings for a week. I'll promise you a
better room than this," he added, glancing
at the box I had moved into as soon
as I realized how much worse than a
pauper I was.</p>

<p>I could hardly express my gratitude as
I tried to thank him, but he pretended
not to perceive my emotion, and said
briskly: "That's settled, then. Send
your stuff round any time to-day, and be
on deck for a seven-o'clock dinner."</p>

<p>You, who know Mrs. Blodgett so
much better than I, can understand my
bewilderment during the first day or two
of my visit. Her husband had jokingly
pictured me as of an Eastern race, which
made the meeting rather embarrassing;
but the moment she comprehended that
I did not habitually sit on the floor, did
not carry a scimiter or kris, and was not
unwashed and ferine, but only a dark
skinned, dark haired, and very silent German
scholar, she took possession of me
as I have seen her do of others. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
preceded me to my room, ringing for a
servant on the way, made me open my
trunk, and directed the maid where to
put each article it contained. She told
me what time to be ready for dinner,
what to wear for it, and at that meal she
had me helped twice to such dishes as
she chose, while refusing to let me have
more than one cup of coffee. To a man
who had never had any one to look after
him in small things it was a novel and
rather pleasant if surprising experience,
and when I grew accustomed to it I
easily understood Mr. Blodgett's chuckles
of enjoyment when she told him he
shouldn't have a third cigar, when she
decided how close he was to sit to the
fire, and finally when she made all of us&mdash;Agnes,
Mr. Blodgett, and myself&mdash;go
to bed at her own hour for retiring.
Best of all I understood Mr. Blodgett's
familiar name for her, "the boss." That
visit was a perfect revelation to me of
affectionate, thoughtful, and persistently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
minute domineering. I do not believe
that the man lives, though he be the
veriest woman-hater, who could help loving
her after a fortnight of her tyranny.
Certainly I could not.</p>

<p>By Mr. Blodgett's aid I secured a
"paper" cable transfer of the money
realized from the bonds and draft, in
order that it might seem to come from
Europe, and sent it to you, writing at his
suggestion, "The inclosed draft on Foster
G. Blodgett &amp; Co. for the sum of
thirty-three thousand dollars is part payment
of principal and interest due you
from estate of William G. Maitland." I
wonder what your thoughts were as you
read the unsigned and typewritten note?</p>

<p>It was your greeting of me by my
alias that led me to accept the incognito.
Perhaps it was cowardly to shirk my
shame by such a means, but it was not
done from cowardice; the thought did
not even occur to me until it opened a
way to knowing you. And in that hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
my very misery became almost happiness,
for its possibilities seemed those of the
Oriental poet who wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My love once offered me a bitter draught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From which in cowardice I flinched.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still she tendered to me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bowing to her wish, I then no longer shrank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But took the cup and put it to my lips.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, marvel! gazing still at her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The potion turned to sweetness as I drank."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If your old friend, Donald Maitland,
were dead to you, your new lover, Rudolph
Hartzmann, might fill his place.
I never stopped to think if such trickery
were right, or rather my love was
stronger than my conscience.</p>

<p>Good-night, my dearest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>X</h2>


<p><i>March 1.</i> During my visit I heard
much about you from Mrs. Blodgett and
Agnes, for your name was constantly on
their lips. From them I learned that
your birth, wealth, and the influence of
your uncle had involved you in a fashionable
society for which you cared nothing,
and that, aside from the gayety which
that circle forced upon you, your time
was spent in travel, and in reading,
music, and charitable work. Except for
themselves, they averred, you had no
intimate friends, and their explanation
of this fact proved to me that you had
taken our separation as seriously as had I.</p>

<p>"After Mr. Walton brought her to
America she spent the first few months
with us," Mrs. Blodgett told me, "and
was the loneliest child I ever saw. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
big eyes used to look so wistfully at times
that I could hardly bear it, yet not a
word did she ever speak of her sorrow.
And all on account of that wretch and
his son! I think the worse men are, the
more a good woman loves them! When
Maizie was old enough to understand,
and Mr. Walton told her how she had
been robbed, she wouldn't believe him
till Mr. Blodgett confirmed the story.
She used to be always talking of the
two, but she has never spoken of them
since that night."</p>

<p>Even more cruel to me was something
Agnes related. She worshiped you with
the love and admiration a girl of eighteen
sometimes feels for a girl of twenty-three,
and in singing your praises,&mdash;to a most
willing listener,&mdash;one day, she exclaimed,
"Oh, I wish I were a man, so that I could
be her lover! I'd make her believe in
love." Then seeing my questioning look,
Agnes continued: "What with her selfish
old uncle, and the men who want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
marry her for her money, and those hateful
Maitlands, she has been made to
distrust all love and friendship. She has
the idea that she isn't lovable,&mdash;that
people don't like her for herself; and I
really think she will never marry, just
because of it."</p>

<p>Better far than this knowledge of you
at second-hand was Mr. Blodgett's telling
me that you were to dine with them during
my visit. It may seem absurd, but
not the least part of my eagerness that
night was to see you in evening dress.
If I had not loved you already, I should
have done so from that meeting; and
although you are dear to me for many
things besides your beauty, I understand
why men love you so deeply who know
nothing of your nature. That all men
should not love you is my only marvel
whenever I recall that first glimpse of
you as you entered the Blodgetts' drawing-room.</p>

<p>Before we had finished our greetings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Mr. Whitely entered, and though I little
realized how vital a part he was to be of
my life, I yet regarded him with instant
interest, for something in his manner
towards you suggested to me that he
coveted the hand you offered him.</p>

<p>A lover does not view a rival kindly,
but I am compelled to own that he is
handsome. If I had the right to cavil, I
could criticise only his mouth, which it
seems to me has slyness with a certain
cruel firmness; but I did not notice this
until I knew him better, and perhaps it
is only my imagination, born of later
knowledge. I am not so blinded by my
jealousy as to deny his perfect manner,
for one feels the polished surface, touch
the outside where one will.</p>

<p>Your demeanor towards him was
friendly, yet with all its graciousness it
seemed to me to have a quality not so
much of aloofness as of limit; conveying
in an indefinable way the fact that such
relations as then existed between you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
were the only possible ones. It was a
shading so imperceptible that I do not
think the Blodgetts realized it, and I
should have questioned if Mr. Whitely
himself were conscious of it, but for one
or two things he said in the course of
the evening, which had to me, under the
veil of a general topic, individual suggestion.</p>

<p>We were discussing that well-worn
question of woman's education, Mrs.
Blodgett having introduced the apple of
discord by a sweeping disapproval of college
education for women, on the ground
that it prevented their marrying.</p>

<p>"They get to know too much, eh?"
laughed Mr. Blodgett.</p>

<p>"No," cried Mrs. Blodgett, "they get
to know too little! While they ought
to be out in the world studying life and
men, so as to choose wisely, they're shut
up in dormitories filling their brains with
Greek and mathematics."</p>

<p>"You would limit a woman's arithme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>tic
to the solution of how to make one
and one, one?" I asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"Surely, Mrs. Blodgett, you do not
mean that an uncultivated woman makes
the best wife?" inquired Mr. Whitely.</p>

<p>"I mean," rejoined Mrs. Blodgett,
"that women who know much of books
know little of men. That's why over-intellectual
women always marry fools."</p>

<p>"How many intellectual wives there
must be!" you said.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't mind if they only married
fools," continued Mrs. Blodgett, "but
half the time they don't marry at all."</p>

<p>"Does that prove or disprove their intellect?"
you asked.</p>

<p>"It means," replied Mrs. Blodgett,
"that they are so puffed up with their
imaginary knowledge that they think no
man good enough for them."</p>

<p>"I've known one or two college boys
graduate with the same large ideas," remarked
Mr. Blodgett.</p>

<p>"But a man gets over it after a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
years," urged Mrs. Blodgett, "and is none
the worse off; but by the time a girl
overcomes the idea, she's so old that no
man worth having will look at her."</p>

<p>"I rather think, Mrs. Blodgett," said
Mr. Whitely, in that charmingly deferential
manner he has with women, "that
some men do not try to win highly educated
women because they are abashed
by a sense of their own inferiority."</p>

<p>"Where do those men hide themselves,
Whitely?" interrogated Mr. Blodgett.</p>

<p>"I'll not question the reason," retorted
Mrs. Blodgett. "The fact that
over-educated girls think themselves
above men is all I claim."</p>

<p>"I don't think, Mrs. Blodgett," you
corrected, "it is so much a feeling of
superiority as it is a change in the aims
of marriage. Formerly, woman married
to gain a protector, and man to gain a
housewife. Now, matrimony is sought
far less for service, and far more for
companionship."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, Miss Walton," questioned Mr.
Whitely, "does not the woman ask too
much nowadays? She has the leisure to
read and study, but a business man cannot
spare the time. Is it fair, then, to
expect that he shall be as cultivated as
she can make herself?"</p>

<p>"That is, I think, the real cause for
complaint," you answered. "The business
man is so absorbed in money-making
that he sacrifices his whole time to
it. I can understand a woman falling in
love with a lance or a sword, dull companions
though they must have been,
but it seems to me impossible for any
woman to love a minting-machine, even
though she might be driven to marry it
for its product."</p>

<p>"That's rough on us, Whitely,"
laughed Mr. Blodgett good-naturedly;
but Mr. Whitely reddened, and you, as
if to divert the subject from this personal
tendency, turned and surmised to
me:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"I suppose that as a German, Dr.
Hartzmann, you think a woman should
be nothing more than a housekeeper?"</p>

<p>"Why not suggest, Miss Walton," I
replied, smiling, "that as an Orientalist I
must think the seraglio woman's proper
sphere?"</p>

<p>"But, Miss Walton," persisted Mr.
Whitely, not accepting your diversion,
"a man, to be successful nowadays,
must give all his attention to his business.</p>

<p>"I presume that is so," you acceded;
"but could he not be content with a little
less success in money-making, and
strive to acquire a few more amenities?"</p>

<p>"Maizie wants us all to be painters
and poets and musicians," asserted Mr.
Blodgett.</p>

<p>"Not at all," you denied.</p>

<p>"Oh, Maizie!" cried Agnes. "You
know you said the other day that you
hoped I wouldn't marry a business man."</p>

<p>"I said '<i>only</i> a business man,' Agnes,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
you replied, without a trace of the embarrassment
so many women would have
shown. "Because men cannot all be
clergymen is no reason for their knowing
nothing of religion. There would be
no painters, poets, or musicians if there
were no dilettanti."</p>

<p>"Yet I think," argued Mr. Whitely,
still as if he were trying to convince you
of something, "that the successful business
man has as much brain as most
writers or artists."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt that is true," you
assented. "So, too, a day laborer may
have a good mind. But of what avail
is a brain if it has never been trained,
or has been trained to know only one
thing?"</p>

<p>"But authors and painters are only
specialists," urged Mr. Whitely.</p>

<p>"They are specialists of a very different
type," you responded, "from the
man whose daily thoughts are engrossed
with the prices of pig-iron or cotton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
sheetings. I think one reason why
American girls frequently marry Europeans
is that the foreign man is so apt
to be more broadly cultivated."</p>

<p>"That's what I mean by saying that
books unfit women to marry wisely," interjected
Mrs. Blodgett. "They marry
foreigners because they are more cultivated,
without a thought of character."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mrs. Blodgett," you observed,
"has not the day gone by for thinking
dullness a sign of honesty? And certainly
a business career is far more likely
to corrupt and harden men's natures than
the higher professions, for its temptations
and strifes are so much greater."</p>

<p>Your opinion was so in accord with
what my father had often preached that
I could not but wonder if his teachings
still colored your thoughts. To test this
idea as well as to learn your present view,
I recurred to another theory of his by
saying, "Does not the broader and more
sensitive nature of the scholar or artist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
involve defects fully as serious as the
hardness and narrowness of the business
man? Some one has said that 'to marry
a literary man is to domesticate a bundle
of nerves.'"</p>

<p>"A nervous irritability," you replied,
"which came from fine mental exertion,
would be as nothing compared to my
own fretting over enforced companionship
with an unsympathetic or sordid nature."
Then you laughed, and added,
"I must have a very bad temper, for it
is the only one which ever really annoys
me."</p>

<p>That last speech told me how thoroughly
the woman of twenty-three was a
development of the child of fourteen, for
I remembered how little my mother's anger
used to disturb you, but how deeply
and strongly your emotions affected you.
I suppose it was absurd, but I felt happy
to think that you had changed so little in
character from the time when I knew
you so well. And from that evening I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
never for an instant believed that you
would marry Mr. Whitely, for I was sure
that you could never love him. How
could I dream that you, with beauty,
social position, and wealth, would make a
loveless marriage?</p>

<p>Good-night, my love.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI</h2>


<p><i>March 2.</i> The truth of the difference
of quality between the business man and
the scholar was quickly brought home
to me. On the last evening of my visit,
Mr. Blodgett revealed the reason for his
latest kindness. "I got you here," he
explained, "to look you over and see
what you were fit for, thinking I might
work you in somewhere. No," he continued,
as he saw the questioning hopefulness
on my face, "you wouldn't do in
business. You've got a sight too much
conscience and sympathy, and a sight
too little drive. All business is getting
the best of somebody else, and you're
the kind of chap who'd let a fellow up
just because you'd got him down." Seeing
the sadness in my face, for I knew
too well he had fathomed me, he added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
kindly, "Don't get chicken-hearted over
what I say. It's easy enough to outwit
a man; the hard thing is not to do it.
I'd go out of the trade to-morrow, if it
weren't for the boss and Agnes, for I
get tired of the meanness of the whole
thing. But they want to cut a figure,
and that isn't to be done in this town
for nothing. I'll find something for you
yet that sha'n't make you sell your heart
and your soul as well as your time."</p>

<p>I was too full of my love and my purpose,
however, for this to discourage me.
The moment my determination to remain
in New York was taken, I wrote to Jastrow,
Humzel, and others of my German
friends, telling them that for business
reasons I had decided to be known as
Rudolph Hartzmann, and asking if they
would stretch friendship so far as to give
me letters in that name to such American
publishers and editors as they knew.
Excepting Jastrow, they all responded
with introductions so flattering that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
was almost ashamed to present them,
and he wrote me that he had not offered
my books for sale, and begged me to reconsider
my refusal of the professorship.
He even offered, if I would accept the
appointment, to divide with me his tuition
fees, and suggested that his own advancing
years were a pledge that his position
would erelong be vacant for me to step
into. It almost broke my heart to have
to write him that I could not accept his
generous offer. In July I received a second
letter from him, most touching in its
attempt to keep back the grief he felt,
but yielding to my determination. He
sent me many good introductions, and
submitted a bid for my library from a
bookseller; but knowing the books to be
worth at least double the offer, I held
the sale in abeyance.</p>

<p>My first six months in New York disheartened
me greatly, though now I
know that I succeeded far better than I
could have expected to do, in the dull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>ness
of the summer. My work was the
proof-reading of my book of travel in
its varying polyglots, seeing through the
press English versions of my two text-books,
and writing a third in both English
and German. Furthermore, my letters
of introduction had made me known to
a number of the professors of Columbia
College, and by their influence I received
an appointment to deliver a course of
lectures on race movements the following
winter; so I prepared my notes in this
leisure time. But this work was far too
little to fill my time, and I wrote all
kinds of editorials, essays, and reviews,
fairly wearing out the editors of the
various magazines and newspapers with
my frequent calls and articles. Finally
I attempted to sell my books to several
libraries; but though the tomes and the
price both tempted several, none had the
money to spend on such a collection.</p>

<p>My book of travel was published in
September, was praised by the reviews,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
and at once sprang into a good sale for
a work of that class; for Europe is interested
in whatever bears on her cancer
growth, commonly called the Eastern
question. Since Europeans approved the
book, Americans at once bought and discussed
it; to prove, I suppose, that as
a nation we are no longer tainted with
provincialism,&mdash;as if that very subservience
to transatlantic opinion were not
the best proof that the virus still works
within us. It was issued anonymously,
through the fear that if I put my pseudonym
on the title-page it might lead to
inquiry about the author which would reveal
his identity with Donald Maitland,
for whom I only wished oblivion. As a
result the question of authorship was
much mooted, some declaring a well-known
Oxford professor to be the man,
others ascribing the volume to a famous
German traveler, and Humzel being
named by some; but most of the reviews
suggested that it was the work of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Eastern savant, and I presume that my
style was tinged with orientalism.</p>

<p>You cannot tell what a delight it was
to me to learn, at our first meeting in the
autumn, that you had read my book. I
went in November to the Lenox Library
to verify a date, and found you there. I
could not help interrupting your reading
for a moment,&mdash;I had so longed for a
glimpse and a word,&mdash;and you took my
intrusion in good part. I drew a book
and pretended to read, merely to veil my
covert watching of you; and when you
rose to go, I asked permission to walk
with you.</p>

<p>"Your notebook suggests that you are
a writer by profession, Dr. Hartzmann?"
you surmised.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you have to come to America
for material?"</p>

<p>"I have come to America permanently."</p>

<p>"How unusual!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"In what respect?"</p>

<p>"For a European writer to come to
New York to do more than lecture about
himself, have his vanity and purse fed,
and return home to write a book about
us that we alone read."</p>

<p>I laughed and said, "You make me
very glad that I am the exception to the
rule."</p>

<p>"I presume more would make the venture
if they found the atmosphere less
uncongenial. New York as a whole is
so absorbed in the task of trans-shipping
the products of the busiest nations of
two continents that everything is ranked
as secondary that does not subserve that
end: and the Muses starve."</p>

<p>"I suppose New York is not the best
of places in which to live by art or letters,
if compared with London or Paris;
yet if a man can do what the world
wants done, he can earn a livelihood
here."</p>

<p>"But he cannot gain the great prizes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
that alone are worth the winning, I fear.
I have noticed that American writers
only reach American audiences, while
European authors not merely win attention
at home, but have vogue and sale
here. The London or Paris label is quite
as effective in New York or Chicago in
selling books as in selling clothes."</p>

<p>"I suppose cultivated Europe is as
heedless of the newer peoples as the peoples
of the Orient are of those of the Occident.
Yet I think that if as good work
were turned out in this country as in the
Old World, the place of its production
would not seriously militate against its
success."</p>

<p>"And have you found it so?"</p>

<p>"Nothing I have yet written in this
country merits Continental attention."</p>

<p>"I hope you have succeeded to your
own satisfaction?"</p>

<p>"It may amuse you to know that
though I had many good letters of introduction
to editors in this country, I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
not get a single article accepted till some
friends of mine in Asia came to my aid."</p>

<p>"You speak in riddles."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you remember reading, last
August, of an outbreak of some tribes in
the Hindoo Kush? Those hill peoples
are in a state of perennial ferment, and
usually Europe pays no attention to their
bellicose proceedings; but luckily for me,
the English premier, at that particular
moment, was holding his unwilling Parliament
together in an attempt to pass
something, and finding it intractable in
that matter, he cleverly used this outbreak
to divert attention and excite
enthusiasm. Rising in the House of
Commons, he virtually charged the outbreak
to Russian machination against
the beloved Emir, and pledged the nation
to support that civilized humanitarian
against the barbaric despot of Russia.
At once the papers were full of unintelligible
cablegrams telling of the doings in
those far-away mountains; and my hur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>riedly
written editorials and articles, which
nevertheless showed some comprehension
of the geography and people, were
snapped up avidly, and from that time I
have found papers or periodicals glad to
print what I write."</p>

<p>You laughed, and said, "How strangely
the world is tied together in these days,
that the speech of an English prime minister
about some Asian septs should give
a German author entrée to New York
editorial sanctums!"</p>

<p>"The cables have done more in aid
of the brotherhood of man than all the
efforts of the missionaries."</p>

<p>"I thought you were a conservative,
and disapproved of modern innovations,"
you suggested archly.</p>

<p>"With innovators, yes."</p>

<p>"Then the Levantine does not entirely
disapprove of our Hesperian city?"</p>

<p>"My knowledge of New York is about
as deep," I answered, smiling, "as my
Eastern blood."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only skin-deep," you said.</p>

<p>"Just sufficient for a disguise."</p>

<p>"As long as you are silent, yes."</p>

<p>"Is my English so unmistakable?"</p>

<p>"Not your tongue, but your thought.
Of course your vicinage, costume, and
complexion made me for a moment accept
your joke of nationality, at that first
meeting, but before you had uttered half
your defense of the older races I felt
sure that you were not a product of one
of them."</p>

<p>"Why was that?"</p>

<p>"Because it is only Christians who
recognize and speak for the rights of
other peoples."</p>

<p>"You forget that the religion of Buddha
is toleration. We Christians preach
the doctrine, but practice extermination,
forgiving our enemies after killing them,"
I corrected. "I do not think we differ
much in works from even El Mahdi."</p>

<p>"Would El Mahdi ever have spoken
for other races?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"You know the weak spot in my
armor, Miss Walton," I was obliged to
confess.</p>

<p>"That is due to you, Dr. Hartzmann.
What you stated that night interested
me so deeply that I have been reading
up about the Eastern races and problems.
I wonder if you have seen this new book
of travel, The Debatable Lands between
the East and West?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I assented, thinking that twenty
over-lookings of it in manuscript and
proof entitled me to make the claim.</p>

<p>"You will be amused to hear that,
when reading it, I thought of you as the
probable writer, not merely because it
begins in the Altai range and ends at
Tangier, but as well because some of the
ideas resemble yours. Mr. Whitely, however,
tells me he has private information
that Professor Humzel is the author.
Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"He was my professor of history at
Leipzig."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>"That accounts for the agreement in
thought. You admire the book?"</p>

<p>"I think it is a conscientious attempt
to describe what the author saw."</p>

<p>"Ah, it is much more than that!"
you exclaimed. "At a dinner in London,
this autumn, I sat next the Earl&mdash;&mdash; next
a member of the Indian Council, and he
told me he considered it a far more brilliant
book than Kinglake's Eothen."</p>

<p>I knew I had no right to continue this
subject, but I could not help asking,
"You liked it?"</p>

<p>"Very much. It seems to me a deep
and philosophic study of present and
future problems, besides being a vivid
picture of most interesting countries and
peoples. It made me long to be a nomad
myself, and wander as the author did.
The thought of three years of such life,
of such freedom, seems to stir in me
all the inherited tendency to prowl that
we women supposedly get from Mother
Sphinx."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Civilization steals nature from us and
compounds the theft with art."</p>

<p>"Tell me about Professor Humzel,"
you went on, "for I know I should like
him, merely from the way he writes.
One always pictures the German professor
as a dried-up mind in a dried-up body,
but in this book one is conscious of real
flesh and blood. He is a young man,
I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Sixty-two."</p>

<p>"He has a young heart, then," you asserted.
"Is he as interesting to talk with
as he makes himself in his book?"</p>

<p>"Professor Humzel is very silent."</p>

<p>"The people who have something to
say are usually so," you sighed.</p>

<p>"A drum must be empty to make a
noise," I said, smiling, "and perhaps the
converse is true."</p>

<p>I cannot say what there was in that
walk which cheered me so, except your
praise of my book,&mdash;sweeter far though
that was than the world's kindly opinion;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
yet over and above that, in our brief interchange
of words, I was made conscious
that there was sympathy between us,&mdash;a
sympathy so positive that something
like our old-time friendship seemed beginning.
And the thought made me so
happy that for a time my troubles were
almost forgotten.</p>

<p>Good-night, Maizie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII</h2>


<p><i>March 3.</i> Fate seemed determined that
our lives should be closely connected.
In December Mr. Blodgett wrote asking
me to call at his office, and he was already
smiling when his boy passed me
through the door at which so many had
to tarry.</p>

<p>"There are a good many kinds of
fools," was his welcoming remark, "but
one of the commonest is the brand who
think because they can do one thing well,
they ought to be able to do the exact
opposite. I've known men who could
grow rich out of brewing beer, who kept
themselves poor through thinking they
knew all about horses; I've known women
who queened it in parlors, who went
to smash because they believed themselves
inspired actresses; I've sat here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
in this office thirty years, and grown rich
through the belief of clergymen, doctors,
merchants, farmers,&mdash;the whole box and
dice,&mdash;that they were heaven-born financiers,
and could play us Wall Street men
even at our own game. Whatever else
you do in this world, doctor, don't think
that because you can talk a dozen languages,
they fit you to be a successful
mute."</p>

<p>"When you are in this mood, Mr.
Blodgett, I can be nothing else," I interpolated,
as he paused a moment for
breath.</p>

<p>"Alexander Whitely," he went on,
smiling, "probably knows more about
petroleum and kerosene than any other
man in the world, and he's made himself
rich by his knowledge. But it doesn't
satisfy him to be on the top of his own
heap; he wants to get on the top of some
other fellow's. In short, he has an itch
to be something he isn't, and the darned
fool's gone and bought a daily newspaper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
with the idea that he is going to be a
great editor!"</p>

<p>"His lamp of genius will not go out
for want of oil," I remarked.</p>

<p>"For a moment he showed one glimmer
of sense: he came to me for advice,"
said Mr. Blodgett in evident enjoyment.
"I told him to get an A 1 business manager,
to make you chief editor, let you
pick your staff, and then blow in all the
money you and the business end asked
for, and never go inside the building himself.
It was too good sense for him, for
he's daft with the idea of showing the
world how to edit a paper. But my advice
simmered down to this: if you want
to be his private secretary, at four thousand
a year, and pretend to revise his
editorials, but really write them for him,
I guess you can have the position. Of
course he is to think he writes the rubbish."</p>

<p>"A Voltaire in miniature," I laughed.</p>

<p>"A what?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>"The great Frederic thought himself a
poet, and induced Voltaire to come and
be his literary counselor. The latter
showed a bundle of manuscripts to some
one and sneered, 'See all this dirty linen
of the king's he has sent me to wash.'"</p>

<p>"That was one for his nibs," chuckled
Mr. Blodgett appreciatively. "But you
mustn't make such speeches as that of
Whitely."</p>

<p>"In spite of my many tongues, I can
be mute."</p>

<p>"Do you think I haven't seen that?
And I've seen something more, which is
that you always give a dollar's worth of
work for seventy-five cents of wages.
Now, Whitely's a hard man, and if you
made the terms with him he'd be sure
to get the better of you. So I've arranged
to have him meet you here, and
I'm going to see fair play. I've told
him you won't do it for less than four
thousand, and he'll not get you a cent
cheaper. The work will be very light."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"The work is easy," I assented, "but
is it honest?"</p>

<p>"Seems to me we had better leave
that to Whitely to settle."</p>

<p>"And is Mr. Whitely an honest man?"</p>

<p>Mr. Blodgett smiled as he looked at me,
and observed, "Whitely wouldn't steal a
red-hot stove unless it had handles! But
he probably thinks this all right. Few
people know how much successful men
use other men's brains. Here's a report
on a Southern railroad by an expert in
my employ. I've never even been over
the road, yet I'll sign my name to the
report as if it was my work. Now, in oil
Whitely hires all kinds of men to do different
things for him, and he gets whatever
credit follows; and I suppose he
thinks that if he pays you to write editorials,
they are as much his as any other
thing he buys."</p>

<p>"He must be conscious of a distinction."</p>

<p>"That's his lookout, if he is. Don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
start in to keep other people's consciences
in order, doctor, for it's the
hardest-worked and poorest-paid trade in
the world."</p>

<p>When Mr. Whitely arrived, Mr. Blodgett
was as good as his word, taking the
matter practically out of my hands, and
letting me sit a passive and amused
spectator of the contest between the two
shrewd men, who dropped all thought of
personal friendship while they discussed
the matter. Mr. Blodgett won, and made
the further stipulation that since Mr.
Whitely intended to be at the office only
in the afternoon, I might be equally privileged
as to my hours of attendance.
His forethought and kindness did more,
for his last speech to Mr. Whitely was,
"Then it's understood that the doctor
writes your letters and revises your editorials,
but nothing else." And as soon
as we were alone he intimated, "Remember
that, or before you know it he'll be
screwing you to death. Don't you write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
anything extra for him unless there's
extra pay. Now, don't waste my time
by thanks in business hours, but come in
to-night to dinner, so as to let the boss
and Agnes congratulate you."</p>

<p>My employment began the first of the
year, at which time the paper came into
the hands of its new proprietor; and it
amuses me to recall him as he sat at his
desk that first day, thrumming it nervously,
and trying to dictate an editorial
on The Outlook for the New Year. A
more hopeless bit of composition I have
seldom read, and four times it was rewritten
as I built it into shape.</p>

<p>The man has no more sense of form
than he has of English. Even worse, he
is almost without ideas. It has become
his invariable custom to remark to me
suavely, as he takes his seat at his desk
about two o'clock, "Dr. Hartzmann, possibly
you can suggest a good subject for
me to write about to-day?" And when
I propose one, he continues: "That is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
satisfactory. Jot down what you think
I had better say, while I run over my
mail." An hour later I lay the typewritten
sheets before him, and, after
reading them with the most evident
pleasure, he puts his initials at the top
and sends the editorial out to the managing
editor; to have a second pleasure
when, after two hours, the galley slips of
proof come back to him.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me, he cares no more
for politics than I do, and thus saves me
from the necessity of studying and mastering
that shifting quicksand against
which beat the tides of men, ebbing as
private greed obtains the mastery, and
flowing in those curious revulsions of
selfishly altruistic public spirit called patriotism.
Except for this subject his
taste is catholic, and his foible is to pose
as omniscient. "I wish new subjects,&mdash;something,
if possible, that intellectual
people do not know about,"&mdash;is his constant
command; and nothing delights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
him more than an editorial on a subject
of which he has never heard. Speaking
only his mother tongue, he has an inordinate
desire for foreign words, and will
observe, "A quotation in another language
gives an editorial page an air of
culture which I desire my paper to have."
Our composing-room, I imagine, is the
only one in New York which has Greek
type, and if I gave him the smallest encouragement
he would buy fonts of Sanskrit
and Hebrew characters. He always
makes me teach him how to pronounce
the sentences, catching them with a wonderful
parrot-like facility. Usually he
carries clippings of the last half dozen
editorials with him, and his delight is to
make an opportunity to read one aloud,
prefaced by the announcement that he is
the writer. Sometimes, indeed, he cannot
contain his pleasure over the articles
till their appearance in type, and I repeatedly
hear him request a visitor, "If
you have ten minutes to spare, let me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
read you this editorial I have just written
for to-morrow's issue."</p>

<p>At first, in spite of Mr. Blodgett's explanation,
I thought this real dishonesty,
and despised not merely him, but myself
as well for aiding in such trickery. As I
grow to know him better, however, I find
he is not cozening the public so much
as imposing on himself. The man has a
fervent and untrained imagination, which
has never, in the practicalities of oil, had
a safety-valve. As a result, it has rioted
in dreams of which he is the hero, until
it has brought him to the point of thinking
his wildest fancies quite possible realities.
His self-faith is so great that his
imagination sets no limit to his powers,
and thus he can believe everything of
himself. I have heard him tell what he
would do under given circumstances, and,
with my knowledge of him, I know he is
conceiving himself to be actually doing
what he describes. Thus, in a smaller
sense, he really imagines that he writes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the editorials, and he even reads them
to Mr. Blodgett, apparently unconscious
that there can be the slightest question
of authorship in the latter's mind.</p>

<p>With this singular weakness the man
is yet a strong one. His capacity to
judge and manage men or facts is truly
marvelous. He rules his paper as he
rules everything, with the firmest hand,
and not a man in his employ but knows
who is master. Within a year he turned
the journal into a great earner of money,
and in the business office they have to
confess that it is all his work, ignorant
though he is to this day of the details.
He knows by instinct where money
should be spent, and where it should be
scrimped. Yet with all this business
shrewdness he cares not half so much
that his investment is paying him twenty
per cent as that people are talking about
his ability as an editor, and my only influence
over him even now is the praise
my editorials have won him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the most singular quality of
his nature is his heedlessness of individual
opinion, and his dread of it in mass.
He is so absolutely self-centred&mdash;every
thought directed inward&mdash;that he never
tries to make the individual like him, yet
he craves intensely the world's esteem.
He longs for notoriety, and even stoops
to an almost daily mention of himself in
his paper, taking endless pains to get his
name into other journals as well. Even
his philanthropy, for which the world
admires him, is used for this purpose.
Ridiculous as it may seem, the most
grating task I have to do is the writing
of the fulsome press dispatches which he
invariably sends out whenever he makes
one of his gifts. He writes, too, to his
fellow editors, asking them to comment
on the largess; and since he makes it
a point to cultivate the pleasantest relations
with his confrères, they give him
good measure, though with many a smile
and wink among themselves when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
get together. "Mr. White-Lie" is his
sobriquet in the fraternity.</p>

<p>How curiously diverse the same man
is to different people! To the world Mr.
Whitely is a man of great business ability,
of wide knowledge, of great benevolence,
and of fine manners. I do not
wonder, Maizie, that he imposes on you;
for though you have discernment, yet
you are not of a suspicious nature, and
his acting is so wonderful and his manner
so frank, through his own unconsciousness
of his self-deceit, that not a dozen
people dream the man is other than he
seems. You might, perhaps, in spite of
his taciturnity, have discovered his charlatan
pretense of learning if you had
been born inquisitive, but you take his
writings for the measure of his intellect,
and have no more reason to suspect that
his skillful reservations are the refuge
of a sciolist than that my silence covers
such little erudition as I have.</p>

<p>Why I can do naught else but sit here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
and write of the past I do not understand.
Until a month ago I was working
every evening till far into the night, but
now, try as I may, I can no longer force
myself to my task. I should think it was
physical exhaustion, were it not that I
can chronicle this stale record of what
I know so well. I suppose it is mental
discouragement at my slight progress in
reducing that crushing debt, and, even
more, my sadness at the thought of you
as his wife.</p>

<p>Good-night, my darling. May happiness
be yours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII</h2>


<p><i>March 4.</i> My impressions of that first
winter in New York are curiously dim
except for the extreme loneliness of my
life, which, after the close companionship
with my father for so many years, seemed
at times almost unbearable. Indeed, I
doubt if I could have borne the long
hours of solitude and toil but for my occasional
glimpses of you. I should think
myself fatuous in claiming that you influence
me physically,&mdash;that I am conscious
of a material glow, ecstasy, thrill,
call it what you please, when with you,&mdash;if
I had not once heard Agnes declare
that she always felt, when you were
in the room, as if she had been drinking
champagne; showing that I am not the
only one you can thus affect.</p>

<p>My pleasantest recollection is of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
long talk in my employer's study; and
strangely enough, it was my books which
gained it for me. Mr. Whitely, when I
first came into his service, had just endowed
a free library in one of the Western
cities where some of his oil interests
centred, and I hinted to him the purchase
of my books as a further gift to
his hobby. The suggestion did not meet
with his approval,&mdash;I fear because there
was not the self-advertising in it that
there is in a money gift,&mdash;but after a
week he told me that he might buy the
collection to furnish his editorial study.
"I plan," he said, "to make my office attractive,
and then have informal literary
receptions once a week. I shall therefore
require some books, and as your library
should be marked by breadth and depth
of learning, I presume it will serve my
purpose."</p>

<p>"There are quite a number of Eastern
manuscripts of value," I told him,
"and few of the books are in languages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
that can be read by the average New
Yorker."</p>

<p>"That gives the suggestion of scholarship
which I wish," he acknowledged.</p>

<p>We easily came to terms under these
circumstances, and I cannot tell you how
happy I was to find myself once more
surrounded by my books. As soon as
they were in place and the study was
handsomely furnished, my employer issued
cards; and though he had nothing
in common with the literary and artistic
set, the mere fact that he controlled the
columns of a great paper brought them
all flocking to his afternoons. It is a
case of mutual cultivation, and I am sick
of being told to write puffs of books and
pictures. Even foreigners do not seem
above this log-rolling, and toady to the
editor of the influential journal. And
yet we think Johnson mean-spirited for
standing at Chesterfield's door! It humiliates
me to see writers and artists
stooping so low merely to get notices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
that are worthless in a critical sense, and
doubly am I degraded that mine is the
pen that aids in this contemptible chicane.</p>

<p>You, Mrs. Blodgett, and Agnes came
to one of these afternoons, and made me
happy, not alone by your presence, but
by an insinuated reproof, which meant, I
thought, that you had become enough interested
in me to care what I did. You
expressed surprise at my being there,
and so I explained to you that I had become
Mr. Whitely's secretary.</p>

<p>"And is your work congenial?" you
asked.</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders, and quoted,
"Civilized man cannot live without dining."</p>

<p>"But you told me you were making a
living. Is not a crust with independence
and a chance to make a name better than
such work?"</p>

<p>"If one is free, yes. But if one must
earn money?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>"I had somehow fixed it in my mind
that you were <i>en garçon</i>. One's fancies
are sometimes very ridiculous. Who invented
the mot that a woman's intuitions
were what she had when she was wrong?"</p>

<p>"Some man, of course," I laughed.
"And you were right in supposing me a
bachelor."</p>

<p>"How little people really know about
one another," you observed, "and yet we
talk of the realism of life! I believe it
is only in fiction that we get it."</p>

<p>"Napoleon said, 'Take away history
and give me a novel: I wish the truth!'
Certainly, our present romance writers
attempt it."</p>

<p>"Only to prove that truth is not art."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"To photograph life in literature is
no more art than a reproduction of our
street sounds would be music."</p>

<p>"Painting and sculpture are copying."</p>

<p>"And the closer the copy, the less the
art."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you would define art as"&mdash;</p>

<p>"The vivifying of work with the personality
of the workman."</p>

<p>"That is not very far from Saadi's
thought that art is never produced without
love."</p>

<p>"I have to confess that you mention
an author of whom I had never even
heard till I read The Debatable Lands.
The extracts printed there made me think
he must be one of the great philosopher
poets of the world. Yet there is no copy
of his works at the Lenox."</p>

<p>"There are copies of all his writings
here."</p>

<p>"I think I shall disobey Polonius by
trying to be a borrower," you announced,
and turning to Mr. Whitely, you asked,
"Do you ever loan your books?"</p>

<p>"To lend to you would be a pleasure,
and give added value to the volume," assented
Mr. Whitely, joining us. "Take
anything you wish."</p>

<p>"Thank you so much. Will you let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
me see what you have of Saadi, so that I
may take my choice?"</p>

<p>"You were speaking of"&mdash;hemmed
Mr. Whitely.</p>

<p>"Saadi."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. Dr. Hartzmann knows
where it is."</p>

<p>When I had led the way to the proper
shelf, you selected the Gulistan, opened
it, and then laughed. "You have the
best protection against borrowers. I
envy both of you the ability to read him
in the original, but it is beyond me."</p>

<p>"As you read Latin, you can read
Gentius' translation of the Bostan," I
suggested, taking the book down.</p>

<p>"How do you know that I can read
Latin?" you asked.</p>

<p>I faltered for a moment, too much
taken aback to think what to reply,
and fortunately Mr. Whitely interposed
quickly, "Miss Walton's reputation for
learning is so well recognized that knowledge
of Latin is taken for granted."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>Taking advantage of the compliment,
I surmised, "Perhaps you will care less
to read the poet if I quote a stanza of
his:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Seek truth from life, and not from books, O fool!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look at the sky to find the stars, not in the pool.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"You only make me the more eager,"
you said, running over the pages.</p>

<p>"The book is worth reading," vouched
Mr. Whitely.</p>

<p>"How good that is!" you appealed to
him, laying your finger on lines to the
effect that a dozen poor men will sleep in
peace on a straw heap, while the greatest
empire is too narrow for two kings.</p>

<p>"Very," answered my employer, after
looking at the text with a critical air. If
you could only have enjoyed the joke
with me!</p>

<p>Suddenly, as I watched you, you became
pale, and glancing down to learn
the cause, I saw a manuscript note in my
father's handwriting on the margin of
the page.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
"Mr. Whitely," you asked huskily,
"how did you get this book?"</p>

<p>Had you looked at me you would have
seen one paler than yourself, as I stood
there expecting the axe to fall. Oh!
the relief when Mr. Whitely replied, "I
bought it in Germany."</p>

<p>You closed the volume, remarking, "I
do not think I will ask the loan, after all.
He seems an author one ought to own."</p>

<p>"I hoped you would add an association
to the book," urged Mr. Whitely.</p>

<p>"Thank you," you parried gravely,
"but so old a volume can hardly be lacking
in association. I think we must be
going."</p>

<p>I took you down to the carriage, and
Mrs. Blodgett kindly offered me the
fourth seat. You were absolutely silent
in the drive up-town, and I was scarcely
less so as I tried to read your thoughts.
What feelings had that scrap of writing
stirred in you?</p>

<p>I have often since then recalled our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
parting words that afternoon, and wondered
if I allowed a mere scruple&mdash;a
cobweb that a stronger man would have
brushed aside without a second thought&mdash;to
wreck my life. If I had taken
what you offered? Perhaps the time
might have come when I could have told
you of my trick, and you would have forgiven
it. Perhaps&mdash;</p>

<p>You said to me graciously, when we
separated at your door, "I shall be very
happy, Dr. Hartzmann, if you will come
to see me."</p>

<p>I flushed with pleasure, for I felt it
was not a privilege you gave to many.
But even as I hesitated for words with
which to express my gratitude, I realized
that I had no moral right to gain your
hospitality by means of my false name;
and when I spoke it was to respond, "I
thank you for the favor most deeply,
Miss Walton, but I am too busy a man
for social calls."</p>

<p>Oh, my darling, if you had known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
what those few words cost me, and the
struggle it was to keep my voice steady
as I spoke them! For I knew you could
only take them to mean that I declined
your friendship. Hide my shame as I
might try to do, I could not escape its
pains. God keep you from such suffering,
Maizie, and good-night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV</h2>


<p><i>March 5.</i> Though I committed the
rudeness of refusing to call, you never in
our subsequent intercourse varied your
manner by the slightest shade, treating
me always with a courtesy I ill deserved.
After such a rebuff, it is true, you were
too self-respecting to offer me again any
favor tending to a better acquaintance,
but otherwise you bore yourself towards
me as you did towards the thousand
other men whom you were obliged to
meet.</p>

<p>Your life as a social favorite, and mine
as a literary hack, gave little opportunity
for our seeing each other, yet we met far
more frequently than would have seemed
possible. Occasionally I found you at
the Blodgetts', though not as often as
our informal footing in that household<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
had led me to hope; for you were in
such social demand that your morning
hours were the time you usually took to
run in upon them. But now and then
we lunched or dined there, and Mrs.
Blodgett little dreamed how willingly I
obeyed her positive command that I was
to come to every one of her afternoons
when Agnes told me that you were to
receive or pour tea. Little I had of
your attention, for you were a magnet to
many, but I could stand near you and
could watch and listen, and that was
happiness.</p>

<p>A cause of meeting more discordant to
me was furnished by my employer. I
wrote for him an editorial on the folk-leid
basis of the Wagner trilogy, which
I suppose he sent or read to you; for
it resulted in a box-party to attend the
series, and I was asked to be one of
the guests. "Nothing like having your
books of reference under your arm," was
Mr. Whitely's way of telling me for what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
purpose I was wanted; and I presume
that was, in truth, the light in which he
viewed me. Though I scorned such service,
the mere fact that you were to be
there was enough to make me accept.
How low love can bring a man if his
spirit is once mastered by it!</p>

<p>I would have sunk far deeper, I believe,
to obtain what I earned, for there
were delightful moments of mutually
absorbing discussions, only too quickly
interrupted by Mr. Whitely or others of
the party breaking in on our conversation.
What was equal happiness to me
was the association of you in my mind
with the noblest of music. I can never
hear certain movements of those operas
without your image coming before me
as clearly as if I saw your reflection in a
mirror. And from that time one of my
keenest pleasures has been to beg tickets
from the musical critic of our staff,
whenever one of the trilogy is to be
given, and sit through the opera dream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>ing
of those hours. I could write here
every word you uttered, but what especially
impressed itself upon my memory
was something called out by the fate of
Brunhilde. As we stood in the lobby
waiting for the carriages, at the end of
Die Walküre, you withdrew a little, as
if still feeling the beauty and tragedy of
the last act too deeply to take part in the
chit-chat with which the rest of the party
beguiled the time. I stood near you,
but, respecting your mood, was silent
too, until you finally broke the pause by
saying, "I do not know whether it is
Wagner's music or because Brunhilde
appeals to me, but I always feel that I
have suffered as she does. It almost
makes me believe in the theory of metempsychosis."</p>

<p>"Is it so much consciousness of a past,
Miss Walton," I suggested, "as prescience
of the future? Woman's story
is so unvaryingly that of self-sacrifice for
love that I should suppose Brunhilde's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
fate would appeal to the sex as a prophecy
rather than as a memory."</p>

<p>"Her punishment could have been far
worse."</p>

<p>"Left a defenseless prey to the first
comer?"</p>

<p>"But surrounded by fire, so that the
first comer must be a brave man."</p>

<p>"Do you value courage so highly?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The truly brave, I think, cannot
be mean, and without meanness there
must be honor. I almost envy Brunhilde
her walls of fire, which put to absolute
proof any man who sought her. The
most successful of men; the most intellectually
brilliant, may be&mdash;By what
can we to-day test courage and honor?"</p>

<p>"There is as much as ever, Miss Walton.
Is it no gain that courage has become
moral rather than physical?"</p>

<p>"Is it no loss that of all the men I
know, there is not one of whom I can say
with certainty, 'He is a brave man'?"</p>

<p>Our numbers were called at this point,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
and the conversation was never continued.
Every word you had said recalled
to me my former friend, and I understood
your repugnance for anything cowardly.</p>

<p>At the last of these operas, by another
perverse joke of Dame Fortune, who
seems to have so many laughs at my expense,
I was introduced to the chaperon,
"Mrs. Polhemus." Looking up, I found
myself facing my mother. I cannot tell
you how strangely I felt in making my
bow. She was as handsome as ever, it
appeared to me, and the smooth rich
olive complexion seemed to have given
her an undying youth. For a moment I
feared recognition, but the difference was
too great between the pallid stooping
boy of fifteen she had last seen in Paris
and the straight bronzed man of twenty-seven.
As of old she was magnificently
dressed and fairly glittered with diamonds,
which curiously enough instantly
brought to my mind the face of my
father as I kissed him last. Was it the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
strong connection of contrast, or was it a
quirk of my brain?</p>

<p>This chance meeting had a sequel that
pains me to this day. Dining the next
evening at the Blodgetts' with you and
your uncle, the latter spoke of my mother's
diamonds. Mrs. Blodgett said,
with a laugh, "One would think, after
her rich marriage, that she might pay up
the money her first husband stole from
Maizie."</p>

<p>"She could have done that years ago
if she had cared to," sneered Mr. Walton.</p>

<p>Your eyes were lowered, and you still
kept them so as you replied, "I would
not accept the money from Mrs. Polhemus."</p>

<p>In my suffering I sat rigid and speechless,
wincing inwardly at each blow of
the lash, when Mr. Blodgett, with a kindness
I can never reward or even acknowledge,
observed, "I believe it was his
wife's extravagance which made William
Maitland a bankrupt and an embezzler.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Till his marriage with her he was a man
of simple habits and of unquestioned
business honesty, but he was caught by
her looks, just as Polhemus has been.
In those first years he could deny her
nothing, and when the disillusionment
came he was too deep in to prevent the
wreck."</p>

<p>"You've been revising your views a
bit," retorted Mr. Walton. "I never expected
to hear you justify any of that
family."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have reason to," replied
Mr. Blodgett.</p>

<p>"I don't believe any of those Maitlands
have the least honesty!" exclaimed
Agnes. "How I hate them!"</p>

<p>"It is not a subject of which I like
to speak," you stated in an evidently
controlled voice, still with lowered eyes,
"but it is only right to say that some one&mdash;I
suppose the son&mdash;is beginning to
pay back the debt."</p>

<p>"Pay back the money, Maizie!" ejacu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>lated
Mr. Walton. "Why haven't you
told me of it?"</p>

<p>"It did not seem necessary," you answered.</p>

<p>"I'm sure it's a trick," asserted Agnes.
"He's probably trying to worm his
way back to your friendship, to get something
more out of you."</p>

<p>"How much"&mdash;began Mr. Walton;
but you interrupted him there by saying,
"I would rather not talk about it."</p>

<p>The subject was changed at once, but
when we were smoking, Mr. Walton
asked, "Blodgett, do you know anything
about that Maitland affair?"</p>

<p>"A little," replied the host.</p>

<p>"The debt really is being paid?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you don't know by whom?"</p>

<p>"So Maizie tells me."</p>

<p>"Has she made no attempt to find
out?"</p>

<p>"When the first payment was made
she came to me for advice."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well?" asked Mr. Walton eagerly.</p>

<p>"She got it," declared Mr. Blodgett.</p>

<p>"What did she do?" persisted Mr.
Walton.</p>

<p>Mr. Blodgett was silent for a moment,
and then responded, "The exact opposite
of what I advised. Do you know,
Walton, you and I remind me of the
warm-hearted elephant who tried to
hatch the ostrich eggs by sitting on
them."</p>

<p>"In what respect?"</p>

<p>"We decided that we must break up
Maizie's love of the Maitlands for her
own good."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, we made the whole thing so
mean to her that finally we did break
something. Then, manlike, we were satisfied.
What was it we broke?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" growled Mr. Walton,
sipping his wine.</p>

<p>Mr. Blodgett laughed slightly. "That's
rather a good name for it," he assented;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
"but the trouble is, Walton, that nonsense
is a very big part of every woman's
life. You'll never get me to fool with it
again."</p>

<p>I often ponder over those three brief
remarks of yours, and of what you said
to me last autumn, in our ride and in the
upper hall of My Fancy, trying to learn,
if possible, what your feeling is towards
us. Can you, despite all that has intervened,
still feel any tenderness and love
for my father and me? Perhaps it was
best that you were silent; if you had
spoken of him with contempt, I think&mdash;I
know you would not, my darling, for
you loved him once, and that, to you,
would be reason enough to be merciful
to the dead, however sinning.</p>

<p>Dear love, good-night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>XV</h2>


<p><i>March 6.</i> You once said to me that
you could conceive of no circumstances
that would justify dishonesty; for, no
matter what the seeming benefits might
be, the indirect consequences and the
effect on the misdoer's character more
than neutralized them. The wrong I
have done has only proved your view,
and I have come to scorn myself for the
dishonorable part I have played. Yet
I think that you would pity more than
blame me, if you could but know my
sacrifices. I drifted into the fraud unconsciously,
and cannot now decide at
what point the actual stifling of my conscience
began. I suppose the first misstep
was when I entered Mr. Whitely's
employment; yet though I knew it to be
unscrupulous in him to impose my edito<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>rials
as his own, it still seemed to me no
distinct transgression in me to write them
for him. With that first act those that
followed became possible, and each involved
so slight an increase in the moral
lapse, and my debt to you was so potent
an excuse to blind me, that at the time
I truly thought I was doing right. I
wonder what you would have done had
you been in my position?</p>

<p>Mr. Blodgett's shrewdness in stipulating
what work I was to do for Mr.
Whitely quickly proved itself. One of
the magazines asked my employer to
contribute an article on The Future of
Journalism. Handing me the letter, he
said, "Dr. Hartzmann, kindly write a
couple of thousand words on that subject."</p>

<p>"That surely is not part of my duty,
Mr. Whitely," I had the courage to respond.</p>

<p>He looked at me quickly, and his
mouth stiffened into a straight line.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
"Does that mean that you do not choose
to do it?" he asked suavely.</p>

<p>My heart failed me at the thought
that if I lost my position I might never
get so good a one, and should drag my
debt through life. For once thought of
you made me cowardly. I answered, "I
will write it, Mr. Whitely;" and he said,
"I thank you," as if I had done him a
favor.</p>

<p>I told Mr. Blodgett of the incident,
that evening, with a wry face and a laugh
over my bravery, and he was furious at
me.</p>

<p>"Why, you&mdash;you"&mdash;he stuttered.
"Haven't you learned yet that the man
wouldn't part with you for anything?
He's so stuck up over his editorials
and what people say of them that he'd
as soon think of discharging his own
mother before she weaned him."</p>

<p>Not content with venting his anger on
me, he came into the office the next day
and told Mr. Whitely I should not be im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>posed
on, and finally forced him to agree
that I should receive whatever the review
paid for the article.</p>

<p>After this I wrote several magazine
articles for Mr. Whitely, and soon another
development of our curious relations occurred.
One afternoon he informed me,
"The Library trustees request me to
deliver an address at the dedication of
the building. I shall be grateful for any
suggestions you can make of a proper
subject."</p>

<p>"Books?" I replied, with an absolutely
grave face.</p>

<p>"That is eminently suitable," he responded.
"Possibly you can spare the
time to compose such a paper; and as it
should be of a scholarly character some
Greek and Latin seem to me advisable."</p>

<p>"How much?" I asked, inwardly
amused to note if he would understand
my question, or would suppose it referred
to the quantity of dead languages I was
to inject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is the labor worth?" he inquired,
setting my doubt at rest, and
proving his business ability to recognize
the most distant allusion to a dollar.
When I named a price, he continued:
"That is excessive. The profession of
authorship is so little recompensed that
there are many good writers in New
York who would gladly do it for less."</p>

<p>"I can do it cheaper, if, like them, I
crib it from books at the Astor," I asserted.</p>

<p>"I do not see why an address composed
in the Astor Library should not be
entirely satisfactory?" he questioned, in
his smooth, self-controlled manner.</p>

<p>"Did you never hear of the man who
left the theatre in the middle of Hamlet
because, he said, he didn't care to hear a
play that was all quotations?" I asked,
with a touch of irony.</p>

<p>"I presume the story has some connection
in your mind with the subject in
hand, but I am unable to see the appo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>siteness?"
he said interrogatively and
evidently puzzled.</p>

<p>"I merely mentioned it lest you might
not know that Pope never lived in Grub
Street."</p>

<p>He looked at me, still ignorant that I
was laughing at him. "You think it injudicious
to have it done by Mather?"
he questioned, naming a fellow who did
special work for the paper at times.</p>

<p>"Not at all," I replied, "provided you
label the address 'hash,' so that people
who have some discrimination won't suppose
you ignorant that it is twice-cooked
meat you are giving them," and, turning,
I went on with my work as if the matter
were ended.</p>

<p>But the next day he told me, "I have
concluded to have you compose that oration,
Dr. Hartzmann;" and from that
moment of petty victory I have not feared
my employer.</p>

<p>I wrote the address, and it so pleased
Mr. Whitely that, not content with de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>livering
it, he had it handsomely printed,
and sent copies to all his friends.</p>

<p>The resulting praise he received clearly
whetted his appetite for authorship, for
not long after he said to me, "Dr. Hartzmann,
you told me, when you sold me
this library, that you were writing a history
of the Turks. How nearly completed
is it?"</p>

<p>"I hope to have it ready for press
within three months."</p>

<p>"For some time," he remarked, "I
have meditated the writing of a book, and
possibly yours will serve my purpose."</p>

<p>I was so taken by surprise that for a
moment I merely gazed at him, since it
seemed impossible that even egotism so
overwhelming as his could be capable of
such blindness; but he was in earnest,
and I could only revert to Mr. Blodgett's
idea that a business man comes to think
in time that anything he can buy is his.
I smiled, and answered, "My book is not
petroleum, Mr. Whitely."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>"If it is what I desire, I will amply
remunerate you," he offered.</p>

<p>"It is not for sale."</p>

<p>"I presume," he replied, "that you
know what disposition of your book suits
you best. I have, however, noticed in
you a strong desire to obtain money, and
I feel sure that we could arrange terms
that will bring you more than you would
otherwise receive."</p>

<p>Even before Mr. Whitely finished
speaking, I realized that I was not a free
agent. I owed a debt, and till it was
paid I had no right to think of my own
ambition or feelings. I caught my breath
in anguish at the thought, and then, fearing
that my courage would fail me, I
spoke hastily: "What do you offer me?"</p>

<p>He smiled blandly as he predicted: "It
is hardly a work that will have a large
sale. The Turkish nation has not played
an important part in history."</p>

<p>"Only conquered the key of the Old
World, caused the Crusades, forced the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
discovery of America and of the Cape
passage, compelled Europe to develop its
own civilization instead of adopting that
of the East, and furnished a question to
modern statesmen that they have yet
found no &OElig;dipus to answer," I retorted.</p>

<p>"Your special pleading does tend to
magnify their position," he assented. "I
shall be happy to look the work over,
leaving the terms to be decided later."</p>

<p>I am ashamed to confess what a night
of suffering I went through, battling with
the love and pride that had grown into
my heart for my book. I knew from the
first moment his proposition had been
suggested that he would give me more
than I could ever hope to make from the
work, and therefore my course was only
too plain; but I had a terrible struggle
to force myself to carry my manuscript
to him the following afternoon.</p>

<p>For the next week he was full of
what he was reading; and had the circumstances
been different, I could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
asked no higher compliment as regards
its popular interest than the enthusiasm
of this unlettered business man for my
book.</p>

<p>"It is quite as diverting as a romance!"
he exclaimed. "I can already see how
astonished people will be when they read
of the far-reaching influence of that nation."</p>

<p>Since the pound of flesh was to be
sold, I took advantage of this mood.
After much haggling, which irritated
and pained me more than it should, Mr.
Whitely agreed to give me six thousand
dollars and the royalties. Good as the
terms were, my heart nearly broke, the
day the manuscript left my hands, for I
had put so much thought into the book
that it had almost become part of myself.
My father, too, had toiled over it,
with fondest predictions of the fame it
would bring me; spending, as it proved,
his very life in the endeavor to make it
a great work. That his love, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
love of my dear professors, and that my
own hopes should all be brought to market
and sold as if they were mere merchandise
was so mercenary and cruel
that at the last moment it was all I could
do to bring myself to fulfill the bargain.
Nothing but my small progress in paying
my debt would have forced me to sell,
and I hope nothing but that would have
led me to join in such dishonesty. It
was, after all, part of the price I was
paying for the original wrong, and but
just retribution against which I had no
right to cry out. Yet for a month I was
so sad that I could scarcely go through
my day's toil; and though that was a
year ago, I have never been able to work
with the same vim, life seems to have so
little left in it for me. And idle as the
thought is, when I think of your praise
of the book I cannot help dreaming of
what might have been if it had been
published in my name; if&mdash;Ah, well,
to talk of "ifs" is only to confess that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
am beaten, and that I will not do. Nor
is the fight over. I never hoped nor attempted
to gain your love, and that he
has won you does not mean failure. To
pay my debt is all I have to do, and
though I may feel more ill and disheartened
than I do to-night, I will pay it,
come what may.</p>

<p>Good-night, my darling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>XVI</h2>


<p><i>March 7.</i> It is little to be proud of,
yet I like to think that though I have
behaved dishonestly, I have not entirely
lost my sense of right and wrong. Twice
at least have I faced temptation and been
strong enough to resist.</p>

<p>When I carried to Mr. Blodgett the
money I received for my book, I was so
profoundly discouraged that my mood
was only too apparent. In his kindness
he suggested that I buy certain bonds of
a railroad his firm was then reorganizing,&mdash;telling
me from his inside knowledge
that a year's holding would give me a
profit of thirty per cent. It was so sore
a temptation to make money without
exertion and practically without risk that
I assented, and authorized him to buy
the securities; but a night's reflection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
made the dishonesty of my act clear to
me, and the next morning I went to his
office and told him I wished to countermand
my order.</p>

<p>"What's that for?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"I have thought better of the matter,
and do not think I have the right."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"If this money were a trust in my
hands, it would not be honest to use it in
speculation, would it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"That is practically what it is, since
it was stolen from a trust, and is to be
returned to it."</p>

<p>He smiled rather grimly. "It's lucky
for Wall Street," he said, "that you literary
fellows don't have the making and
enforcing of laws; and it's luckier still
that you don't have to earn your living
down here, for the money you'd make
wouldn't pay your burial insurance."
Yet though he laughed cynically, he
shook my hand, I thought, more warmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
than usual when we parted, as if he felt
at heart that I had done right.</p>

<p>Much easier to resist was an offer of
another kind. Very foolishly, I told Mr.
Whitely that I had received a letter from
the literary editor of the leading American
review asking if I would write the
criticism of the History of the Turks.</p>

<p>"That is a singular piece of good fortune,"
Mr. Whitely said cheerfully, "and
guarantees me a complimentary notice in
a periodical that rarely praises."</p>

<p>"That is by no means certain," I answered.
"You know as well as I that it
does not gloze a poor book, nor pass over
defects in silence."</p>

<p>"But you can hardly write critically of
your own book!" cried Mr. Whitely, for
once giving me a share in our literary
partnership. "For if there are defects
you ought to have corrected them in
proof."</p>

<p>"Of course I do not intend to write
the review!" I exclaimed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not write it? Why not?" he questioned
in amazement equal to mine.</p>

<p>"Because I am absolutely unfitted to
do it."</p>

<p>"Why, you know all about the subject!"</p>

<p>"I mean that no author can for a moment
write discriminatingly of his own
work; and besides, the offer would never
have been made if my connection with
the book were known."</p>

<p>"But they will never know."</p>

<p>"I should."</p>

<p>"You mean to say you do not intend
to do it?"</p>

<p>"I shall write to-night declining."</p>

<p>"But I want you to do it."</p>

<p>"And I don't."</p>

<p>"What would they probably pay you
for it?"</p>

<p>"What it is worth."</p>

<p>"If you will reconsider your determination,
I will double the amount."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately," I laughed bitterly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
"there are limits to what even <i>I</i> will
sell."</p>

<p>"I will give you two hundred and fifty
dollars if you will write a laudatory review
of my book," he offered.</p>

<p>"Have you ever dealt in consciences,
Mr. Whitely?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Occasionally."</p>

<p>"Did you ever get any as cheap as
that?"</p>

<p>"Many."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you were buying shopworn
and second-hand articles," I retorted;
"or you may have gone to some
bargain counter where they make a specialty
of ninety-eight and forty-nine cent
goods."</p>

<p>He never liked this satirical mood into
which he sometimes drove me. He hesitated
an instant, and then bid, "Three
hundred."</p>

<p>"This reminds me of Faust," I remarked;
but he was too intent on the
matter in hand to see the point.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose it's only a question of
amount?" he suggested blandly.</p>

<p>"You are quite right, Mr. Whitely. I
will write you that review if you will pay
me my price," I assented.</p>

<p>"I knew it," he asserted exultingly.
"But you are mistaken if you think I
will pay any fancy price."</p>

<p>"Then it's a waste of time to talk any
more about it," I answered, and resumed
my work.</p>

<p>"It isn't worth three hundred, even,"
he argued, "but you may tell me what
you will do it for."</p>

<p>"I will write that review for one hundred
and twenty-one thousand dollars," I
replied.</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"And from that price I will not abate
one cent," I added.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, I did not write the
notice.</p>

<p>It was amusing to see his eagerness
for the criticisms of the book. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
three American critical journals had notices
eminently characteristic of them.
The first was scholarly, praising moderately,
with a touch of lemon-juice in the
final paragraph that really only heightened
its earlier commendation, but which
made the book's putative author wince;
the second was discriminating and balanced,
with far more that was complimentary;
while the third was the
publisher's puff so regularly served up,&mdash;a
colorless, sugary mush,&mdash;which my
employer swallowed with much delectation.
I am ashamed to say that I greatly
enjoyed his pain over any harsh words.
He always took for granted that the
criticisms were correct, never realizing
that as between an author, who has spent
years on a book, and the average critic,
who is at best superficial in his knowledge
of a subject, the former is the more
often right of the two. I tried to make
this clear to him one day by asking him
if he had never read Lord Brougham's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
review of Byron or Baron Jeffrey's review
of Coleridge, and even brought him
the astonishing tirades of those world-renowned
critics; but it was time wasted.
He preferred a flattering panegyric in
the most obscure of little sheets to a
really careful notice which praised less
inordinately; yet while apparently believing
all the flattery, he believed all the
censoriousness as well, even in those
cases known to every author where one
critic praises what another blames.</p>

<p>"A Western paper says you do not
know how to write English," he complained
one day. "You ought to have
taken more pains with the book, Dr.
Hartzmann."</p>

<p>"The Academy and The Athenæum
both thought my style had merit," I answered,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless there must be something
wrong, or this critic, who in other
respects praises with remarkable discrimination,
would certainly not have gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
out of his way to mention it," he replied
discontentedly.</p>

<p>Fortunately, unfavorable criticism, both
in Europe and in America, was the exception,
and not the rule; the book was
generally praised, and sprang into an instant
sale that encouraged and cheered
me. Mr. Whitely was immensely gratified
at the sudden reputation it achieved
for him, and even while drinking deep of
the mead of fresh authorship told me he
thought he would publish another book.
I knew it was an opportunity to make
more money, but for some reason I felt
unequal to beginning anew on what would
be a purely mercenary task. I mentioned
my plan of a work on the Moors, and
promised, when I felt able to commence
it, I would talk with him about terms.
That was three months ago, yet every
day I seem to feel less inclination, and in
fact less ability, to undertake the labor.
For three years I have toiled to the utmost
of my strength, and forced myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
to endure the most rigid economy. It
is cowardly, but at times I find myself
hoping my present want of spirit and
energy is the forerunner of an illness
which will end the hopeless struggle.</p>

<p>Good-night, dear heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p><i>March 8.</i> Each day I determine to
spend my evening usefully, but try as I
may, when the time comes I feel too
weary to do good work, and so morbidly
recur to these memories. I ought to
fight the tendency, the more that in reverting
to the past I seem only to dwell
on its sadness, thus intensifying my own
depression. Let me see if I cannot for
one night write of the good fortune that
has come to me in the last three years.</p>

<p>Pleased with the success of my book
of travel and text-books, and knowing of
my wish for work, the American publishers
offered me the position of assistant
editor of their magazine and reader of
manuscripts. By hard work and late
hours the task could be done in my
mornings and evenings, allowing me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
continue in Mr. Whitely's employ; so I
eagerly accepted the position. I can imagine
few worse fates than reading the
hopeless and impossible trash that comes
to every publisher; but this was not my
lot, for I was to read only the manuscripts
that had been winnowed of the
chaff. Yet this very immunity, as it
proved, nearly lost me an opportunity of
trying to be of service to you.</p>

<p>Returning a bundle of stuff to the
manuscript clerk one day, I saw "M.
Walton, 287 Madison Avenue, New
York City," in your handwriting, on the
cover of a bulky pile of sheets on his
desk. Startled, I demanded, "What is
this?"</p>

<p>"It's a rejected manuscript I was on
the point of wrapping to return," the
clerk answered.</p>

<p>Opening the cover, I saw, "A Woman's
Problem, a Novel, by Aimez Lawton."
It needed little perception to detect
your name in the anagram.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mrs. Graham has rejected it?" I
asked, and he nodded.</p>

<p>"Give me the file about it, please," I
requested; and after a moment's search
he handed me the envelope, and I
glanced over its meagre contents: a brief
formal note from you, submitting it, and
the short opinion of the woman reader.
"Traces of amateurishness, but a work of
considerable power and feeling, marred
by an inconclusive ending," was the epitome
of her opinion, coupled with the
recommendation not to accept.</p>

<p>"Register it on my list, and I'll take
it and look it over," I said, and went to
my little editorial cuddy, feeling actually
rich in the possession of the manuscript.
Indeed, it was all I could do to go through
my morning quota of proof-reading and
"making up" dummy forms for the magazine's
next issue, I was so eager for
your book.</p>

<p>A single reading told me you had put
the problem of your life into the story.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
It is true the heroine was different enough
in many respects to make analogy hardly
perceptible, though she too was a tender,
noble woman. She had never felt the
slightest responsive warmth for any of
her lovers, but she was cramped by the
social conventions regarding unmarried
women, and questioned whether her life
would not be more potent if she married,
even without love. One of her lovers
was a man of force, brains, wealth, and
ambition, outwardly an admirable match,
respected by the world, and, most of all,
able to draw about him the men of genius
and intellect she wished to know, but
whom her society lot debarred her from
meeting. Yet your heroine was conscious
of faults: she felt in him a touch
of the soil that repels every woman instinctively;
at times his nature seemed
hard and unsympathetic, and his scientific
work, for which he was famous, had
narrowed his strong mind to think only
of facts and practicalities, to the exclu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>sion
of everything ideal or beautiful. In
the end, however, his persistent wooing
convinced her of the strength of his feeling;
and though she was conscious that
she could never love him as she wished
to love, the tale ended by her marrying
him. Am I to blame for reading in this
the story of Mr. Whitely's courtship of
you? I only marveled at how much of
his true character you had detected under
his veneer.</p>

<p>To me the story was sweet and noble.
I loved your heroine from beginning to
end. She was so strong even in her
weaknesses; for you made her no unsubstantial
ideal. I understood her craving
something more than her allotted round
of social amusements, and her desire for
intercourse and friendship with finer and
more purposeful people than she daily
met. I even understood her willingness
to accept love, when not herself feeling
it; for my own life was so hungry-hearted
that I had come to yearn for the slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>est
tenderness, no matter who the giver
might be.</p>

<p>As soon as I realized that the story
was your own, I hoped it might tell me
something of your thoughts of my father
and myself; but that part of your life
you passed over as if it never had been.
Was the omission due to too much feeling
or too little? I have always suspected
that I served as a model for one
of your minor characters: a dreamy, unsocial
being, curiously variable in mood;
at times talking learnedly and even wittily,
but more often absolutely silent.
He was by profession an artist, and you
made him content to use his talent on
book and magazine illustration, apparently
without a higher purpose in life
than to earn enough to support himself,
in order that he might pass the remainder
of his time in an intellectual indulgence
scarcely higher in motive than more material
dissipation. His evident sadness
and lack of ambition was finally discov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>ered
to be due to a disappointment in
love; and as a cure, your heroine introduced
him to her best friend,&mdash;a young
girl,&mdash;and through her influence he was
roused to some ambition, and in the end
he dutifully fell in love as your heroine
wished. It was a sketch that made me
wince, and yet at which I could not help
but laugh. I suppose it was a true picture,
and I am quite conscious that at
times I must seem ridiculous to you; for
often my mood is such, or my interest
in you is so strong, that I forget even
the ordinary courtesies and conventions.
There is a general idea that a lover is
always at his best when with the woman
he loves, but, from my own experience, I
think he is quite as likely to be at his
worst. To watch your graceful movements,
to delight in the play of expression
on your face, and to catch every inflection
in your voice and every word you
speak are pleasures so engrossing to me
that I must appear to you even more ab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>stracted
than I ordinarily am, though a
dreamer at best. And yet now and then
I have thought you were conscious of a
tenderness in me, which, try as I will, I
cannot altogether hide.</p>

<p>The main fault of the novel was unquestionably
that most accented by the
reader, and, recognizing the story as the
problem of your life, I understood why
you supplied no solution to the riddle.
You begged the question you propounded;
the fact that your heroine married the
hero being no answer, since only by the
results of that marriage would it be possible
to say if she had chosen the better
part. It was this that convinced me you
were putting on paper your own thoughts
and mood. You were debating this
theme, and could carry it in imagination
to the point of marriage; but what lay
beyond that was unknowable, and you
made no attempt to invent a conclusion,
the matter being too real to you to be
merely a subject for artistic idealism and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
invention. Hitherto I had classed Mr.
Whitely with your other lovers, feeling
sure that you could not love him any
more than you could any of them; but
now for the first time I began to fear his
success.</p>

<p>After reading the story three times I
carried it back to the manuscript clerk;
and when I had allowed sufficient time
for it to be returned, I wrote you a long
letter, telling how I had come to read
the story, and making a careful criticism
and analysis of both its defects and its
merits. I cannot tell you what a labor
of love that letter was, or how much
greater pains I took over your book than
I have ever taken over any writing of my
own. What was perhaps unfair, after
pointing out the inconclusiveness of your
ending, I sketched what I claimed was
the logical end to the story. Thinking
as I did that I knew the original in your
mind, I was more influenced by my knowledge
of him than I was by the character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213.png---Tony" id="Page_213.png---Tony">[Pg 213.png---Tony]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
in your book, and therefore possibly my
inference was unjust. But in hopes of
saving you from Mr. Whitely, I pictured
a sequel in which your heroine found
only greater loneliness in her loveless
union, her husband's love proving a tax,
and not a boon; and marriage, instead of
broadening her life, only bent and narrowed
it by just so much as a strong-willed
and selfish man would inevitably
cramp the life of one over whom law and
public opinion gave him control.</p>

<p>I was richly rewarded by your letter of
thanks. You were so winning in your
sweet acceptance of all my criticisms,
and so lovable in your simple gratitude,
that I would have done a thousand times
the work to earn such a letter. Yet
even in this guerdon I could not escape
the sting of my unhappy lot; for, unable
to reconcile my distant conduct with the
apparent trouble I had taken, you asked
me to dinner, leaving me to select the
day, and spoke of the pleasure it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214.png---Tony" id="Page_214.png---Tony">[Pg 214.png---Tony]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
give you to have an opportunity to talk
over the book with me.</p>

<p>I can think of few greater delights
than to have gone over your story, line
by line and incident by incident. My
love pleaded with me to take the chance,
pointing out that it would do you no
harm, but on the contrary aid you, and
I found a dozen specious reasons; but
tempt me as they might, I always came
back to the truth that if you knew who I
really was you would not invite me, nor
accept a favor at my hands. In the end
I wrote you that my time was so mortgaged
that I must deny myself the pleasure.
A small compensation was my
offer that if you chose to rewrite the
story and send me the manuscript, I
would gladly read it over again and make
any further suggestions which occurred
to me. You thanked me by letter gracefully,
but I was conscious of your bewilderment
in the very care with which you
phrased your note; and when next we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215.png---Tony" id="Page_215.png---Tony">[Pg 215.png---Tony]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
met I could see that I had become more
an enigma than ever,&mdash;for which there
is indeed small wonder.</p>

<p>God keep you, my darling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216.png---Tony" id="Page_216.png---Tony">[Pg 216.png---Tony]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p><i>March 9.</i> What seemed my misfortune
proved quite the reverse. You evidently
mentioned to Agnes my refusing
to dine with you, and the next time I
saw her she took me to task for it.</p>

<p>"It's too bad of you," she told me,
"when I have explained to you how sensitive
Maizie is, and how she has the idea
that nice men do not like her, that you
should go and confirm her in the feeling
by treating her so! Why don't you like
her?"</p>

<p>"I do," was all I said.</p>

<p>"No, you don't," she denied indignantly.
"I suppose men dislike fine women
because they make them feel what
poor things they are themselves!"</p>

<p>"I like you, Miss Blodgett," I replied.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," she retorted, "or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217.png---Tony" id="Page_217.png---Tony">[Pg 217.png---Tony]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
you would be nice to my best friend.
Besides, the idea of mentioning me in the
same breath as Maizie! Men are born
geese."</p>

<p>"Then you should pity rather than upbraid
us," I suggested.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I intend to do,"
went on Agnes. "You promised us a
visit this summer, and I am going to arrange
for Maizie to be there at the time,
so that you can really get to know her.
And then, if you don't like her, I'll never
forgive you."</p>

<p>"Now, Agnes," ordered Mrs. Blodgett
crossly, "stop teasing the doctor. I'm
fond of Maizie, but I'm fairly tired with
men falling in love with her, and I am
glad to find one who hasn't."</p>

<p>All last spring and summer, as I toiled
over the proof sheets of my history, I
was waiting and dreaming of that promised
fortnight with you. I was so eager
in my hope that when I found Agnes at
the station, it was all I could do not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
make my greeting a question whether
you were visiting them. Luckily, she
was almost as eager as I was, and hardly
was I seated in the trap when she announced,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mamma wanted to ask you when we
were alone, and wouldn't hear at first of
even Maizie being with us; but I told
papa of my plan, and he insisted that
Maizie should be invited. Wasn't he an
old love? And now, Dr. Hartzmann,
you'll try to like Maizie, won't you?
And even if you can't, just pretend that
you do, please."</p>

<p>If the groom had not mounted the
rumble at this point, I believe I should
have told her of my love for you, the impulse
was so strong, in my gratitude and
admiration for the unselfish love she had
for you.</p>

<p>A result of this misunderstanding was
an amusing game of cross-purposes between
mother and daughter. Agnes was
always throwing us together, scarcely at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>tempting
to veil her wishes, while Mrs.
Blodgett, thinking that I did not care for
you, was always interfering to save me
from your society. She proposed that I
should teach Agnes chess, and left us
playing; but when you joined us, Agnes
insisted that she could learn more by
watching us, only to play truant the moment
you had taken her place. I shall
never forget Mrs. Blodgett's amazement
and irritation, on her return, at finding
us playing, and Agnes not to be seen.
Equally unsuccessful was an attempt to
teach Agnes fencing, for she grew frightened
before the foils had really been
crossed, and made you take her place.
At first I imagined she only pretended
fear, but Mrs. Blodgett became so very
angry over her want of courage that I
had to think it genuine. When we went
to drive as a party there was always much
discussion as to how we should sit; and
in fact my two friends kept at swords'
points most of the time, in their en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>deavors
to make me tolerate or save me
from the companionship of the woman I
loved. Even I could see the comedy of
the situation.</p>

<p>In one of our conversations you reverted
to your novel, and questioned my
view of the impossibility of the heroine
being happy in her marriage, evidently
influenced, but not convinced, by my
opinion.</p>

<p>"To me it is perfectly conceivable,"
you argued, "that, regardless of her loving,
a woman can be as happy married as
single, and that it all depends upon what
she makes of her own life."</p>

<p>"But in marriage," I contended, "she
is not free to make her life at all."</p>

<p>"Surely she is if her husband truly
loves her."</p>

<p>"Less so than if he does not."</p>

<p>"You are not in earnest?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Love makes women less selfish,
but with many men it often has the
opposite effect. The man you drew, Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
Walton, was so firm that he would not
be other than selfish, and if my reading
of your heroine is correct, she was a
woman who would resign her own will,
rather than lower her self-respect by
conflicts with her husband."</p>

<p>"But he loved her."</p>

<p>"In a selfish man's way. If women
knew better what that meant, there would
be fewer unhappy marriages."</p>

<p>"Then you are sure my heroine did
wrong?"</p>

<p>"I think she did what thousands of
other women have done,&mdash;she married
the love rather than the lover."</p>

<p>"No. I did not intend that. She
married for quite other things than love:
for greater freedom, for"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Would she have married," I interrupted,
"if she had not been sure that
the hero loved her?"</p>

<p>You thought an instant, and then said,
"No, I suppose not&mdash;and yet"&mdash;You
stopped, and then continued impulsively,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
"I wonder if I shall shock you very
much if I say that I have no faith in
what we call love?"</p>

<p>"You do not shock me, Miss Walton,
because I do not believe you."</p>

<p>"It is true, nevertheless. Perhaps it
is my own fault, but I have never found
any love that was wholly free from self-indulgence
or self-interest."</p>

<p>"If you rate love so low, why did you
make your heroine crave it?"</p>

<p>"One can desire love even when one
cannot feel it."</p>

<p>"Does one desire what one despises?"</p>

<p>"To scorn money does not imply a
preference for poverty."</p>

<p>"The scorn of money is as genuine as
your incapacity to love, Miss Walton."</p>

<p>"You do not believe me?"</p>

<p>"A person incapable of love does not
crave it. It is only a loving nature which
cares for love."</p>

<p>"But if one cannot love, how can one
believe in it?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>"The unlighted torch does not believe
in fire."</p>

<p>"But some substances are incombustible."</p>

<p>"The sun melts anything."</p>

<p>"The sun is trans-terrestrial."</p>

<p>"So is love."</p>

<p>You looked at me in silence for a moment,
and then asked, "Is love so much
to you?"</p>

<p>"Love is the only thing worth striving
for in this life," I replied.</p>

<p>"And if one fails to win it?"</p>

<p>"One cannot fail, Miss Walton."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because the best love is in one's own
heart and depends only on one's self."</p>

<p>"And if one has loved," you responded
hurriedly, with a mistiness in your eyes
which proved how deeply you were feeling,
"if one gives everything&mdash;only to
find the object base&mdash;if"&mdash;You stopped
speaking and looked away.</p>

<p>"One still has the love, Miss Walton;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
for it is that which is given, and not that
which is received, that is worth the having."
I faltered in my emotion, and
then, almost unconscious of what I said,
went on: "For many years I have loved,&mdash;a
love from the first impossible and
hopeless. Yet it is the one happiness of
my present life, and rather than"&mdash;I
recovered control of myself, and became
silent as I heard Mrs. Blodgett coming
along the veranda.</p>

<p>You leaned forward, saying softly,
"Thank you for the confidence." Then,
as Mrs. Blodgett joined us, you said,
"I envy you your happiness, Dr. Hartzmann."</p>

<p>"What happiness is that?" asked Mrs.
Blodgett, glancing from one to the other
curiously.</p>

<p>"Dr. Hartzmann," you explained
calmly, without a trace of the emotion
that had moved you a moment before,
"has been proving to me that all happiness
is subjective, and as I have never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
been able to rise to such a height I am
very envious of him."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," remarked
Mrs. Blodgett. "But if the doctor
wants to know what real happiness is,
he had better marry some nice girl and
have his own home instead of living in a
boarding-house."</p>

<p>You laughed, and added, "Now our
happiness becomes objective. Perhaps it
is the best, after all, Dr. Hartzmann."</p>

<p>"Do <i>you</i> think so, Miss Walton?" I
asked, unable to prevent an emphasis in
the question.</p>

<p>You rose, saying, "I must dress for
dinner." But in the window you turned,
and answered, "I have always thought
it was, but there are evident exceptions,
Dr. Hartzmann, and after what you have
told me I think you are one of them."</p>

<p>"And not yourself?" I could not help
asking.</p>

<p>You held up your hand warningly.
"When the nature of dolls is too deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
questioned into, they are found to contain
only sawdust."</p>

<p>"And we often open the oyster, to
find sometimes a pearl."</p>

<p>"The result of a morbid condition,"
you laughed back.</p>

<p>"Better disease and a pearl than health
without it."</p>

<p>"But suppose one incapable of the
ailment? Should one be blamed if no
pearl forms?"</p>

<p>"An Eastern poet said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Diving and finding no pearl in the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blame not the ocean,&mdash;the fault is in thee.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Have you ever tried to find a pearl, Miss
Walton?"</p>

<p>You hesitated a moment. "Like the
Englishman's view of the conundrum,"
you finally parried archly, "that would
be a good joke if there only wasn't something
to 'guess' in it."</p>

<p>"Do you know what Maizie is talking
about?" demanded Mrs. Blodgett discontentedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>"Better than Miss Walton does herself,
I think," I averred.</p>

<p>You had started to go, but again you
turned, and asked with interest, "What
<i>do</i> I mean?"</p>

<p>"That you believe what you think you
don't."</p>

<p>You stood looking at me for a moment.
"We are becoming friends, Dr. Hartzmann,"
you affirmed, and passed through
the window.</p>

<p>Good-night, dear friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XIX" id="XIX"></a>XIX</h2>


<p><i>March 10.</i> For the remainder of my
visit, it seemed as if your prophecy of
friendship were to be fulfilled. From
the moment of my confidence to you, all
the reserves that had been raised by my
slighting of your invitations disappeared,
perhaps because the secret I had shared
with you served to make my past conduct
less unreasonable; still more, I believe,
because of the faith in you it evidenced
in me. Certain I am that in the following
week I felt able to be my true self
when with you, for the first time since
we were boy and girl together. The difference
was so marked that you commented
on the change.</p>

<p>"Do you remember," you asked me,
"our conversation in Mr. Whitely's study,
when I spoke of how little people really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
knew one another? Here we have been
meeting for over three years, and yet I
find that I haven't in the least known
you."</p>

<p>It is a pleasure to me to recall that
whole conversation, for it was by far the
most intimate that we ever had,&mdash;so
personal that I think I should but have
had to question to learn what I long to
know. In response to my slight assistance,
to the sympathy I had shown, you
opened for the moment your heart; willing,
apparently, that I should fathom
your true nature.</p>

<p>We had gone to dinner at the Grangers'
merely to please Mrs. Blodgett, for
we mutually agreed that in the country
formal dinners were a weariness of the
flesh; and I presume that with you, as
with me, this general objection of ours
was greatly strengthened when we found
Mrs. Polhemus among the guests. It is
always painful to me to be near her, and
her dislike of you is obvious enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
make me sure that her presence is equally
disagreeable to you. It is a strange
warp and woof life weaves, that I owe
to one for whom we both feel such repulsion
the most sympathetic, the tenderest
conversation I have ever had with
you.</p>

<p>I was talking with Miss Granger, and
thus did not hear the beginning of my
mother's girds at you; but Agnes, who
sat on my left, told me later that, as
usual, Mrs. Polhemus set out to bait you
by remarks superficially inoffensive, but
covertly planned to embarrass or sting.
The first thing which attracted my notice
was her voice distinctly raised, as if she
wished the whole table to listen, and in
fact loud enough to make Miss Granger
stop in the middle of a sentence and
draw our attention to the speaker.</p>

<p>"&mdash;sound very well," Mrs. Polhemus
was saying, "and are to be expected
from any one who strives to be thought
romantically sentimental."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did not know," you replied in a low
voice, "that a 'romantically sentimental'
nature was needed to produce belief in
honesty."</p>

<p>"It is easy enough to talk the high
morals of honesty," retorted your assailant,
"and I suppose, Miss Walton, that
for you it is not difficult to live up to
your conversational ideals. But we unfortunate
earthly creatures, who cannot
achieve so rarefied a life, dare not make
a parade of our ethical natures. The
saintly woman is an enormously difficult
rôle to play since miracles went out of
style."</p>

<p>"Oh, leave us an occasional ideal, Mrs.
Polhemus," laughed a guest. "I for one
wish that fairy rings and genii were still
the vogue."</p>

<p>"But we have some kinds of miracles,"
asserted Mrs. Granger. "Remember the
distich,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'God still works wonders now and then:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold! two lawyers, honest men!'"<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></div></div>

<p>"With all due deference to Miss Walton's
championing of absolute perfection,"
continued my mother, with a cleverly
detached manner, to veil what lay back
of the sneer, "I find it much easier to
accept the miracle of an honest lawyer
than that of an absolutely uncattish woman,"&mdash;a
speech which, like most of
those of Mrs. Polhemus, drew a laugh
from the men.</p>

<p>"That's because you don't know Miss
Walton!" exclaimed Agnes warmly, evidently
fretted by such conduct towards
you.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," answered my mother,
speaking coolly and evenly, "I presume
I have known Miss Walton longer
and better than any one else in this room;
and I remember when her views of honesty
were such that her ideal was personified
by a pair of embezzlers."</p>

<p>You had been meeting her gaze across
the table as she spoke, but now you
dropped your lids, hiding your eyes be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>hind
their long lashes; and nothing but
the color receding from your cheeks,
leaving them as white as your throat and
brow, told of what you felt.</p>

<p>"Oh, say something," appealed Agnes
to me in a whisper. "Anything to divert
the"&mdash;</p>

<p>"And I really think," went on Mrs.
Polhemus, smiling sweetly, with her eyes
on you, "that if you were as thoroughly
honest with us as, a moment ago, you
were insistent on the world's being, you
would confess to a <i>tendresse</i> still felt for
that particular form of obliquity."</p>

<p>I shall recall the moment which followed
that speech if it shall ever fall to
me to sit in the jury-box and pass judgment
on a murderer, for I know that had
I been armed, and my mother a man, I
should have killed her; and it taught me
that murder is in every man's heart.
Yet I was not out of my head, but was
curiously clear-minded. Though allusion
to my shame had hitherto always made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
me dumb, I was able to speak now without
the slightest difficulty; I imagine
because the thought of your pain made
me forget my own.</p>

<p>"Which is better, Mrs. Polhemus," I
asked, with a calmness I marveled at
afterwards, "to love dishonesty or to dishonestly
love?"</p>

<p>"Is this a riddle?" she said, though
not removing her eyes from you.</p>

<p>"I suppose, since right and wrong are
evolutionary," I rejoined, "that every
ethical question is more or less of a conundrum.
But the thought in my mind
was that there is only nobility in a love
so great that it can outlast even wrongdoing."
Then, in my controlled passion,
I stabbed her as deeply as I could make
words stab. "Compare such a love, for
instance, with another of which I have
heard,&mdash;that of a woman who so valued
the world's opinion that she would not
get a divorce from an embezzling husband,
because of the social stigma it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>volved,
yet who remarried within a week
of hearing of her first husband's death,
because she thought that fact could not
be known. Which love is the higher?"</p>

<p>The color blazed up in my mother's
cheeks, as she turned from you to look
at me, with eyes that would have killed
if they could; and it was her manner, far
more than even the implication of my
words, which told the rest of the table
that my nominally impersonal case was
truly a thrust of the knife. A moment's
appalling pause followed, and then, though
the fruit was being passed, the hostess
broke the terrible spell by rising, as if
the time had come for the ladies to withdraw.</p>

<p>When, later, the men followed them,
Agnes intercepted me at the door, and
whispered, "Oh, doctor, it was magnificent!
I was so afraid Maizie would
break down if&mdash;I never dreamed you
could do it so splendidly. You're almost
as much of a love as papa! It will teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the cat to let Maizie alone! Now, do
you want to be extra good?"</p>

<p>"So long as you don't want any more
vitriol-throwing," I assented, smiling.
"Remember that a hostess deserves
some consideration."</p>

<p>"I told Mrs. Granger that you did it
at my request, and there wasn't a woman
in the room who didn't want to cheer.
We all love Maizie, and hate Mrs. Polhemus;
and it isn't a bit because you geese
of men think she's handsome and clever,
either. Poor Maizie wanted to be by
herself, and went out on the veranda. I
think she's had time enough, and that
it's best for some one to go to her.
Won't you slip out quietly?"</p>

<p>I nodded, and instantly she spoke
aloud of the moon, and we went to the
French window on the pretense of looking
at it, where, after a moment, I left
her. At first I could not discover you,
the vines so shadowed your retreat; and
when I did, it was to find you with bowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
head buried in your arms as they rested
on the veranda rail. The whole attitude
was so suggestive of grief that I did not
dare to speak, and moved to go away.
Just as I turned, however, you looked up,
as if suddenly conscious of some presence.</p>

<p>"I did not intend to intrude, Miss
Walton, and don't let me disturb you. I
will rejoin"&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you came out for the moonlight
and quiet, sit down here," you said, making
room for me.</p>

<p>I seated myself beside you, but made
no reply, thinking your allusion to quiet
perhaps voiced your own preference.</p>

<p>"It seems needless," you began, after
a slight pause, "to ignore your kindness,
even though it was veiled. I never felt
so completely in another's power, and
though I tried to&mdash;to say something&mdash;to
strike back&mdash;I couldn't. Did
my face so betray me that you knew I
needed help?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your face told nothing, it seemed to
me."</p>

<p>"But that makes it positively uncanny.
Over and over again you appear to divine
my thoughts or moods. Do you?"</p>

<p>"Little more than any one can of a
person in whom one is interested enough
to notice keenly."</p>

<p>"Yet no one else does it with me.
And several times, when we have caught
each other's eyes, we have&mdash;at least I
have felt sure that you were laughing
with me, though your face was grave."</p>

<p>"Who was uncannily mind-reading
then?"</p>

<p>"An adequate <i>tu quoque</i>," you said,
laughing; then you went on seriously;
"Still, to be frank, as now I think we
can be, I have never made any pretense
that I wasn't very much interested in you&mdash;while
you&mdash;well&mdash;till very lately, I
haven't been able to make up my mind
that you did not actually&mdash;no, not dislike&mdash;for
I knew that you&mdash;I could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
be unconscious of the genuine esteem
you have made so evident&mdash;yet there
has always been, until the last two weeks,
an indefinable barrier, of your making, as
it appeared to me, and from that I could
only infer some&mdash;I can give it no name."</p>

<p>"Were there no natural barriers to a
friendship between a struggling writer
and Miss Walton?"</p>

<p>"Surely you are above that!" you
exclaimed. "You have not let such a
distinction&mdash;Oh no, for it has not
stood in the way of friendship with the
Blodgetts."</p>

<p>A moment's silence ensued, and then
you spoke again: "Perhaps there was a
motive that explains it. Please don't reply,
if it is a question I ought not to put,
but after your confidence of last week I
feel as if you had given me the privilege
to ask it. I have always thought&mdash;or
rather hoped&mdash;that you cared for Agnes?
If"&mdash;</p>

<p>"And so you married me to her in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
the novel," I interrupted, in an effort to
change the subject, dreading to what it
might lead.</p>

<p>You laughed merrily as you said, "Oh,
I'm so glad you spoke of that. I have
often wondered if you recognized the
attempted portrait,&mdash;which now I know
is not a bit of a likeness,&mdash;and have
longed to ask you. I never should have
dared to sketch it, but I thought my pen
name would conceal my criminality; and
then what a fatality for you to read it! I
never suspected you were the publisher's
reader. What have you thought of me?"</p>

<p>"That you drew a very pleasant picture
of my supposed mental and moral attainments,
at the expense of my ambition and
will. My true sympathy, however, went
out to the girl whom you offered up as a
heart-restorer for my earlier attachment."</p>

<p>"I'm thankful we are in the shadow,"
you laughed, "so that my red cheeks
don't show. You are taking a most
thoroughgoing revenge."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>"That was the last thought in my
mind."</p>

<p>"Then, my woman's curiosity having
been appeased, be doubly generous and
spare my absurd blushes. I don't know
when I have been made to feel so young
and foolish."</p>

<p>"Clearly you are no hardened criminal,
Miss Walton. Usually matchmakers
glory in their shame."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should if I had not been
detected, or if I had succeeded better."</p>

<p>"You took, I fear, a difficult subject
for what may truly be called your maiden
experiment."</p>

<p>"Did I not? And yet&mdash;You see I
recognized potentialities for loving in you.
You can&mdash;Ah, you have suggested to
me a revenge for your jokes. Did you&mdash;were
you the man who coined the
phrase that my eyes were too dressy for
the daytime?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I confessed guiltily, "but"&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, don't dare to try to explain it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
away," you ordered. "How could you
say it? We can never be friends, after
all."</p>

<p>Though you spoke in evident gayety, I
answered gravely: "You will forgive me
when I tell you that it was to parry a
thrust of Mrs. Polhemus's at you, and I
made a joke of it only because I did not
choose to treat her gibe seriously. I
hoped it would not come back to you."</p>

<p>"Every friend I have has quoted it,
not once, but a dozen times, in my presence.
If you knew how I have been
persecuted and teased with that remark!
You are twice the criminal that I have
been, for at least my libel was never
published. Yet you are unblushing."</p>

<p>We both sat silent for a little while,
and then you began: "You interrupted
a question of mine just now. Was it a
chance or a purposed diversion? You
see," you added hastily, "I am presuming
that henceforth we are to be candid."</p>

<p>"I confess to an intention in the dodg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>ing,
not because I feared the question,
for a simple negative was all it needed,
but I was afraid of what might follow."</p>

<p>"I hoped, after the trust of the other
day&mdash;You do not want to tell me your
story?"</p>

<p>"Are there not some things that cannot
be put into words, Miss Walton?
Could you tell me your story?"</p>

<p>"But mine is no mystery," you replied.
"It has been the world's property for
years. Why, your very help to-night
proves that it is known to you,&mdash;that
you know, indeed, facts that were unknown
to me."</p>

<p>"Facts, yes; feelings, no."</p>

<p>"Do you appreciate the subtilty of
the compliment? You really care for
such valueless and indefinable things as
feelings?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"A bargain, then, while you are in this
mood of giving something for nothing.
Question for question, if you choose."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can tell your secrets?"</p>

<p>"To you, yes, for you have told me
your greatest."</p>

<p>"Then, with the privilege of silence
for both, begin."</p>

<p>"Ah, you begin already to fear the
gimlet! Yes. Nothing is to be told
that&mdash;There again we lack a definition,
do we not? Never mind. We shall understand.
You knew her in Germany?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And she&mdash;You wear a mask, at
moments even merry-faced, but now and
again I have surprised a look of such sadness
in your eyes that&mdash;Is that why
you came to America? She"&mdash;</p>

<p>"No. She was, and is, in so different
a class, that I never"&mdash;</p>

<p>"You should not allow that to be a
bar! Any woman"&mdash;</p>

<p>"But even more, there are other
claims upon me, which make marriage
out of the question."</p>

<p>"And this is why you have resigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
reputation for money-making? Is there
no escape? Oh, it seems too cruel to
be!"</p>

<p>"You draw it worse than it is, Miss
Walton, forgetting that I told you of my
happiness in loving."</p>

<p>"You make me proud to feel that we
are friends, Dr. Hartzmann," you said
gently. "I hope she is worthy of such
a love?"</p>

<p>I merely nodded; and after a slight
pause you remarked, "Now it is only fair
to give you a turn."</p>

<p>I had been pondering, after my first
impulsive assent, over my right to win
your confidence, with the one inevitable
conclusion that was so clear, and I answered,
"I have no questions to ask,
Miss Walton."</p>

<p>"Then I can ask no more, of course,"
you replied quietly, and at once turned
the conversation into less personal subjects,
until the time came for our return
to My Fancy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>When we parted in the upper hall, that
evening, you said to me, "I always value
your opinion, and it usually influences me.
Do you, as your speech to-night implied,
think it right to go on loving baseness?"</p>

<p>"It is not a question of right and
wrong, but only whether the love remains."</p>

<p>"Then you don't think it a duty to
crush it out?"</p>

<p>"No. All love is noble that is distinct
from self."</p>

<p>You held out your hand. "I am so
glad you think so, and that you spoke
your thought. You have done me a
great kindness,&mdash;greater far than you
can ever know. Thank you, and good-night."</p>

<p>Good-night, Maizie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XX" id="XX"></a>XX</h2>


<p><i>March 11.</i> When I left My Fancy,
after my visit, Agnes had nothing but
praise for me. "I was certain that you
and Maizie would be friends if you ever
really knew each other," she said triumphantly.
Unfortunately, our first meeting
in the city served only to prove the
reverse. In one of my daily walks up-town,
I met you and Agnes outside a shop
where you had been buying Christmas
gifts for the boys of your Neighborhood
Guild. You were looking for the carriage,
about which there had been some
mistake, and I helped you search. When
our hunt was unsuccessful, you both said
you would rather walk than let me get
a cab, having been deterred only by the
growing darkness, and not by the snow.
So chatting merrily, away we went,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
through the elfin flakes which seemed so
eager to kiss your cheeks, till your home
was reached.</p>

<p>"If we come in, will you give us some
tea?" asked Agnes.</p>

<p>"Tea, cake, chocolates, and conversation,"
you promised.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," I said, "but I cannot
spare the time."</p>

<p>I thought you and Agnes exchanged
glances. "Please, Doc&mdash;" she began;
but you interrupted her by saying proudly,
"We must not take any more of Dr.
Hartzmann's time, Agnes. Will you
come in?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Agnes. "I'll go home
before it's any darker. Good-night."</p>

<p>I started to walk with her the short
distance, but the moment we were out of
hearing she turned towards me and cried,
"I hate you!" As I made no reply, she
demanded impatiently, "What makes you
behave so abominably?" When I was
still silent she continued: "I told you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
how Maizie felt, and I thought it was all
right, and now you do it again. It's too
bad! Well, can't you say something?
Why do you do it?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing for me to say, Miss
Blodgett," I responded sadly.</p>

<p>"You might at least do it to please
me," she persisted, "even if you don't like
Maizie."</p>

<p>I made no answer, and we walked the
rest of the distance in silence. At the
stoop, however, Agnes asked, "Will you
go with me to call on Maizie, some afternoon?"</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"Not even to please mamma and me?"
she questioned.</p>

<p>Again I gave the same answer, and
without a word of parting she left me
and passed through the doorway. From
that time she has treated me coldly.</p>

<p>Another complication only tended to
increase the coldness, as well as to involve
me with Mrs. Blodgett. In December,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
Mr. Blodgett came into Mr. Whitely's
office and announced, "I've been taking
a liberty with your name, doctor."</p>

<p>"For what kindness am I indebted
now?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"I'm a member of the Philomathean,"
he said,&mdash;"not because I'm an author,
or artist, or engineer, or scientist, but because
I'm a big frog in my own puddle,
and they want samples of us, provided
we are good fellows, just to see what
we're like. I was talking with Professor
Eaton in September, and we agreed you
ought to be one of us; so we stuck your
name up, and Saturday evening the club
elected you."</p>

<p>"I can't afford it"&mdash;I began; but he
interrupted with:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I knew you'd say that, and so didn't
tell you beforehand. I'll bet you your
initiation fee and a year's dues against a
share of R. T. common that you'll make
enough out of your membership to pay
you five times over."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>"How can I do that?"</p>

<p>"All the editors and publishers are
members," he replied, "and to meet
them over the rum punch we serve on
meeting nights is worth money to the
most celebrated author living. Then
you'll have the best club library in this
country at your elbow for working purposes."</p>

<p>"I don't think I ought, Mr. Blodgett."</p>

<p>He was about to protest, when Mr.
Whitely broke in upon us, saying, "Accept
your membership, Dr. Hartzmann,
and the paper shall pay your initiation
and dues."</p>

<p>I do not know whether Mr. Blodgett
or myself was the more surprised at this
unexpected and liberal offer. Our amazement
was so obvious that Mr. Whitely
continued: "I think it'll be an excellent
idea for the paper to have a member of
its staff in the Philomathean, and so the
office shall pay for it."</p>

<p>"Whitely," observed Mr. Blodgett ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>miringly,
"you're a good business man,
whatever else you are!"</p>

<p>"I wish, Blodgett," inquired Mr.
Whitely, "you would tell me why I have
been kept waiting so long?"</p>

<p>"Many a name's been up longer than
yours," replied Mr. Blodgett in a comforting
voice. "You don't seem to realize
that the Philomathean's a pretty stiff
club to get into."</p>

<p>"But I've been posted for over three
years, while here Dr. Hartzmann is elected
within four months of his proposing."</p>

<p>"Well, the doctor has the great advantage
of being a sort of natural Philomath,
you see," Mr. Blodgett explained genially.
"He was born that way, and so is ripe
for membership without any closet mellowing."</p>

<p>"But my reputation as a writer is
greater than Dr."&mdash;began Mr. Whitely;
but a laugh from Mr. Blodgett made him
halt.</p>

<p>"Oh come, now, Whitely!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked my employer.</p>

<p>"Once St. Peter and St. Paul stopped
at a tavern to quench their thirst," said
Mr. Blodgett, "and when the time came
to pay, they tossed dice for it. Paul
threw double sixes, and smiled. Peter
smiled back, and threw double sevens.
What do you suppose Paul said, Whitely?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"'Oh, Peter, Peter! No miracles between
friends.'"</p>

<p>"I don't follow you," rejoined Mr.
Whitely.</p>

<p>Mr. Blodgett turned and said to me,
"I'm going West for two months, and
while I'm gone the Twelfth-night revel
at the Philomathean is to come off. Will
you see that the boss and Agnes get
cards?" Then he faced about and remarked,
"Whitely, I'd give a big gold
certificate to know what nerve food you
use!" and went out, laughing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>When I took the invitations to Mrs.
Blodgett, I found you all with your heads
full of a benefit for the Guild, to be given
at your home,&mdash;a musical evening, with
several well-known stars as magnets, and
admission by invitation as an additional
attraction. Mrs. Blodgett said to me in
her decisive way, "Dr. Hartzmann, the
invitations are five dollars each, and you
are to take one."</p>

<p>I half suspected that it was only a device
to get me within your doors, though
every society woman feels at liberty to
whitemail her social circle to an unlimited
degree. But the fact that the entertainment
was to be in your home, even more
than my poverty, compelled me to refuse
to be a victim of her charitable kindness
or her charitable greed. I merely shook
my head.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you must," she urged. "It
will be a delightful evening, and then it's
such a fine object."</p>

<p>"Do not ask it of Dr. Hartzmann,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
you protested, coming to my aid. "No
one"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm sure it's very little to ask," remarked
Mrs. Blodgett, in a disappointed
way.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Blodgett," I said, in desperation,
"for years I have denied myself every
luxury and almost every comfort. I have
lived at the cheapest of boarding-houses;
I have walked down-town, rain or shine,
to save ten cents a day; I have"&mdash;I
stopped there, ashamed of my outbreak.</p>

<p>"I suppose, Dr. Hartzmann," retorted
Agnes, with no attempt to conceal the
irritation she felt toward me, "that the
Philomathean is one of your ten-cent
economies?"</p>

<p>Before I could speak you changed the
subject, and the matter was dropped,&mdash;I
hoped for all time. It was, however, to
reappear, and to make my position more
difficult and painful than ever.</p>

<p>At Mrs. Blodgett's request, made that
very day, I sent you an invitation to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
Philomathean ladies' day. It was with
no hope of being there myself, since my
editorial duties covered the hours of the
exhibition; but good or bad fortune aided
me, for Mr. Whitely asked me for a
ticket, and his absence from the office
set me free. The crowd was great, but,
like most people who try for one thing
only, I attained my desire by quickly
finding you, and we spent an enjoyable
hour together, studying the delicious
jokes and pranks of our artist members.
The truly marvelous admixture of absurdity
and cleverness called out the real
mirth of your nature, and our happiness
and gayety over the pictures strangely
recalled to me our similar days spent in
Paris and elsewhere. You too, I think,
remembered the same experience, for
when we had finished, and were ascending
the stairs to the dining-room, you
remarked to me, "I never dreamed that
one could be so merry after one had
ceased to be a child. For the last hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
I have felt as if teens were yet
unventured lands."</p>

<p>I confess I sought a secluded spot in
an alcove, hoping still to keep you to myself;
but the project failed, for when I
returned from getting you an ice, I found
that Mr. Whitely had joined you. The
pictures, of course, were the subject of
discussion, and you asked him, "Are all
the other members as clever in their own
professions as your artists have shown
themselves to be?"</p>

<p>"The Philomathean is made up of an
able body of men," replied Mr. Whitely
in a delightfully patronizing tone. "Some
few of the very ablest, perhaps, do not
care to be members; but of the second
rank, you may say, broadly speaking, that
it includes all men of prominence in this
city."</p>

<p>"But why should the abler men not
belong?"</p>

<p>"They are too occupied with more
vital matters," explained my employer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yet surely they must need a club,
and what one so appropriate as this?"</p>

<p>"It is natural to reason so," assented
the would-be member. "But as an actual
fact, some of the most prominent
men in this city are not members," and
he mentioned three well-known names.</p>

<p>The inference was so unjust that I
observed, "Should you not add, Mr.
Whitely, that they are not members
either because they know it is useless to
apply, or because they have applied in
vain; and that their exclusion, though superficially
a small affair, probably means
to them, by the implication it carries,
one of the keenest mortifications of their
lives?"</p>

<p>"You mean that the Philomathean refuses
to admit such men as Mr. Whitely
named?" you asked incredulously.</p>

<p>I smiled. "The worldly reputation
and the professional reputation of men
occasionally differ very greatly, Miss
Walton. We do not accept a man here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
because his name appears often in the
newspapers, but because of what the
men of his own calling know and think
of him."</p>

<p>"And of course they are always jealous
of a man who has surpassed them,"
contended Mr. Whitely.</p>

<p>"There must be something more
against a man than envy of his confrères
to exclude him," I answered. "My loyalty
to the Philomathean, Miss Walton,
is due to the influence it exerts in this
very matter. Errors are possible, but
the intention is that no man shall be of
our brotherhood who is not honestly doing
something worth the doing, for other
reasons than mere money-making. And
for that very reason, we are supposed,
within these walls, to be friends, whether
or not there is acquaintance outside of
them. We are the one club in New York
which dares to trust its membership list
implicitly to that extent. Charlatanry
and dishonesty may succeed with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
world, but here they fail. Money will
buy much, but the poorest man stands
on a par here with the wealthiest."</p>

<p>"You make me envious of you both,"
you sighed, just as Mrs. Blodgett and
Agnes joined us.</p>

<p>"What are you envying them?" asked
Agnes, as she shook hands with you,&mdash;"that
they were monopolizing you?
How selfish men are!"</p>

<p>"In monopolizing this club?"</p>

<p>"Was that what you envied them?"
ejaculated Mrs. Blodgett. "I for one
am glad there's a place to which I can't
go, where I can send my husband when
I want to be rid of him." Then she
turned to Mr. Whitely, and with her
usual directness remarked, "So they've
let you in? Mr. Blodgett told me you
would surely be rejected."</p>

<p>Mr. Whitely reddened and bit his lip,
for which he is hardly to be blamed. But
he only bowed slightly in reply, leaving
the inference in your minds that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
a Philomath. How the man dares so
often to&mdash;</p>

<p>The striking clock tells me it is later
than I thought, and I must stop.</p>

<p>Good-night, dear heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XXI" id="XXI"></a>XXI</h2>


<p><i>March 12.</i> Our talk at the Philomathean
and Mr. Whitely's tacit assumption
of membership had their penalty for
me,&mdash;a penalty which, to reverse the
old adage, I first thought an undisguised
blessing. When we separated, he asked
me to dinner the following evening, to
fill in a place unexpectedly left vacant;
and as I knew, from a chance allusion,
that you were to be there, I accepted a
courtesy at his hands.</p>

<p>Although there were several celebrities
at the meal, it fell to my lot to sit on
your right; my host, who took you down,
evidently preferring to have no dangerous
rival in your attention. But Mrs.
Blodgett, who sat on his other side, engaged
him as much as she chose, and
thus gave me more of your time than I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
should otherwise have had. If you knew
how happy it made me that, whenever
she interrupted his monopoly of you, instead
of making a trialogue with them,
you never failed to turn to me!</p>

<p>"I have just re-read Mr. Whitely's
book," you remarked, in one of these interruptions,
"and I have been trying to
express to him my genuine admiration
for it. I thought of it highly when first
I read it, last autumn, but on a second
reading I have become really an enthusiast."</p>

<p>I suppose my face must have shown
some of the joy your words gave me, for
you continued, "Clearly, you like it too,
and are pleased to hear it praised. But
then it's notorious that writers are jealous
of one another! Tell me what you
think of it?"</p>

<p>I tried to keep all bitterness out of my
voice as I laughed. "Think how unprofessional
it would be in me to discuss
my employer's book: if I praised it, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
necessary; if I disparaged it, how disloyal!"</p>

<p>"You are as unsatisfactory as Mr.
Whitely," you complained. "I can't get
him to speak about it, either. He smiles
and bows his head to my praise, but not
a word can he be made to say. Evidently
he has a form of modesty&mdash;not stage
fright, but book fright&mdash;that I never before
encountered. Every other author
I have met was fatiguingly anxious to
talk about his own writings."</p>

<p>"Remember in our behalf that a book
stands very much in the same relation to
a writer that a baby does to its mother.
We are tolerant of her admiration; be
equally lenient to the author's harmless
prattle."</p>

<p>"I suppose, too," you went on, "that
the historian is less liable to the disease,
because his work is so much less his own
flesh and blood; so much less emotional
than that of the poet or novelist."</p>

<p>"No book worth reading ever fails to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
be steeped with the spirit of the person
who wrote it. The man on the stage is
instinct with emotion and feeling, but
does he express more of his true individuality
than the man in real life? The
historian puts fewer of his own feelings
into his work, but he plays far less to the
gallery, and so is more truthful in what
he reveals of himself."</p>

<p>"Your simile reminds me of a thought
of my own, after my first reading of this
book: that the novelist is the demagogue
of letters, striving to please, and suing
for public favor by catering to all its
whims and weaknesses; but the historian
is the aristocrat of literature, knowing
the right, and proudly above taking heed
of popular prejudice or moods. I liked
Mr. Whitely's book for many things, but
most of all for its fearless attitude towards
whatever it touched upon. I felt
that it was the truth, because the whole
atmosphere told me that a man was writing,
too brave to tell what was untrue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
That evidently pleases you, again," you
laughed. "Oh, it is horrible to see this
consuming jealousy!"</p>

<p>When the ladies withdrew, the men, as
usual, clustered at one end of the table;
but my host beckoned me to join him,
and sat down apart from his guests.</p>

<p>"Dr. Hartzmann, what is the matter
at the Philomathean?" he demanded, in
a low voice.</p>

<p>"Matter?" I questioned.</p>

<p>"Yes. What is the reason they don't
elect me?"</p>

<p>"I am not on the membership committee,
Mr. Whitely," I replied.</p>

<p>"Are you popular up there? Mr.
Blodgett said that you were."</p>

<p>"I have some good friends," I answered.</p>

<p>"Then electioneer and get me put in,"
he explained, revealing to me in a flash
why he had volunteered that the paper
should pay the expenses of my membership.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am hardly in a position to do that."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I am a new member, and my position
under you is so well known that it would
be very indelicate in me to appear in the
matter."</p>

<p>"For what do you suppose I helped
you, then?" he asked severely.</p>

<p>"I did not understand till now."</p>

<p>"Well, then, drop your talk about delicacy,
and get your friends to elect me."</p>

<p>"I do not think I can do that," I answered
mildly.</p>

<p>"Then you won't earn your pay?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Whitely, when you made the offer,
you put it on an entirely different
ground, and it is unfair to claim that it
involved any condition that was not then
expressed."</p>

<p>"But you ought to be willing to do it.
Haven't you any gratitude about you?"</p>

<p>"I understood that you wanted one of
your staff a member of that club. Had
you mentioned your present motive, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
should certainly have refused to accept
the offer; and under these circumstances
I decline to recognize any cause for gratitude."</p>

<p>"What is your objection to doing it,
though?" he persisted.</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mr. Whitely, I do not think
I am called upon to say more than I
have said."</p>

<p>"Do you want me in the club or not?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"I shall certainly never oppose your
election in any way whatsoever."</p>

<p>"But you will not work for me?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Are you waiting to see how much
I'll give?"</p>

<p>My hand trembled at the insult, but I
made no reply.</p>

<p>"Come," he continued, "are you
standing out in hopes I will offer you
something?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"How much?" he asked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have been elected to the Philomathean,
Mr. Whitely," I said, concluding
that an explanation might be the easiest
escape, after all, "and to it I owe a distinct
duty. If you were not my employer,
I should feel called upon to work
against you."</p>

<p>"Why?" he exclaimed, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Is it necessary to say?" I answered.</p>

<p>"Yes. What is your objection to
me?"</p>

<p>"Did you never read Æsop's fable of
the jackdaw?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That's it, is it? And you are opposing
my election?"</p>

<p>"By not the slightest act."</p>

<p>"Then why did Blodgett predict that
I would surely be rejected? I've a reputation
as a writer, as a philanthropist,
and as a successful business man. What
more do they want?"</p>

<p>"As I told Miss Walton yesterday,"
I explained, "a man's true and eventual
reputation depends, not on what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
world thinks of him, but on what his
fellow-craft decide."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"There is scarcely an author or editor
at the Philomathean who is not opposed
to your election, Mr. Whitely."</p>

<p>"You have been telling tales," he muttered
angrily.</p>

<p>"You should know better."</p>

<p>"Then what have they against me?"</p>

<p>"Any man who works with his pen
learns that no one can write either editorials
or books, of the kind credited to
you, without years of training. The most
embarrassing ordeal I have to undergo is
the joking and questioning with which
the fraternity tease me. But you need
never fear my not keeping faith."</p>

<p>"Yet you won't help me into the
Philomathean?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"So you'll make money out of me,
but think your club too good?"</p>

<p>"I owe my club a duty."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know," he went on smoothly,
"that you're an awful screw, when
there's a dollar in sight. How much do
you want?"</p>

<p>My silence should have warned him,
but he was too self-absorbed to feel anything
but his own mood.</p>

<p>"How much do you want?" he repeated,
and I still sat without speaking,
though the room blurred, and I felt as if
I were stifling. "The day I'm elected
to the Philomathean, I'll give you"&mdash;</p>

<p>I rose and interrupted him, saying,
"Mr. Whitely, if you wish me to leave
your house and employment, you can obtain
my absence in an easier way than by
insulting me."</p>

<p>For a moment we faced each other in
silence, and then he rose. "Hereafter,
Dr. Hartzmann, you will pay those dues
yourself," he said in a low voice, as he
moved towards the door.</p>

<p>I only bowed, glad that the matter
was so easily ended; and for nearly two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
months our relations have been of the
most formal kind that can exist between
employer and employed.</p>

<p>Far more bitter was another break.
When the moment of farewell came, that
evening, I waited to put you and Mrs.
Blodgett into your carriages, and while
we were delayed in the vestibule you
thanked me again for the pleasure of the
previous afternoon, and then continued:
"I understand why you did not feel able
to please Mrs. Blodgett about the concert.
But won't you let me acknowledge
the pleasure of yesterday by sending you
a ticket? I have taken a number, and
as all my circle have done the same, I
am finding it rather difficult to get rid
of them."</p>

<p>"That's all right, Maizie," interjected
Mrs. Blodgett, who had caught, or inferred
from an occasional word that she
heard, what you were saying. "We took
an extra ticket, and I am going to use
the doctor for an escort that evening."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thank you both," I answered, "but
I shall not be able to attend the concert."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" sniffed Mrs. Blodgett, as
I helped her into her carriage. "You're
going to do as I tell you."</p>

<p>You did not speak in the moment we
waited for your coupé to take its place,
but as the tiger opened the door you
looked in my face for the first time since
my words, showing me eyes that told of
the pain I had inflicted.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," you said quietly. "I
had thought&mdash;hoped&mdash;that we were to
be friends."</p>

<p>There was nothing for me to say, and
we parted thus. From that time I have
seen little of you, for when I meet you
now you no longer make it possible for
me to have much of your society. And
my persistent refusal to go to the concert
with Mrs. Blodgett and Agnes increased
their irritation against me, so that I am
no longer asked to their home, and thus
have lost my most frequent opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
of meeting you. But harder even than
this deprivation is the thought that I
have given you pain; made all the
greater, perhaps, because so ill deserved
and apparently unreasonable. I find myself
longing for the hour when we shall
meet at that far-away tribunal, where all
our lives, and not alone that which is
seen, will stand revealed. For two
months I have not had a single moment
of happiness or even hope. I am lonely
and weary, while my strength and courage
seem to lessen day by day. Oh, my
darling, I pray God that thought of you
will make me stronger and braver, that I
may go on with my fight. Good-night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XXII" id="XXII"></a>XXII</h2>


<p><i>March 13.</i> Last night, at the Philomathean,
Mr. Blodgett joined me, and
asked me why I had not dined with them
lately. He returned only a few days ago,
and was thus ignorant that I have not
been inside his door for weeks. I hesitated
for an instant, and then replied, "I
have been working very hard."</p>

<p>"What are you usually doing?" he
asked, smiling. "Come in to Sunday
dinner to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I shall be too busy with a lot of manuscripts
I have on hand, that must be
read," I told him.</p>

<p>"Stop killing yourself," he ordered.
"As it is, you look as if you were on the
brink of a bad illness. You won't get on
a bit faster by dying young."</p>

<p>There the matter rested, and I did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
go to dinner to-day, being indeed glad to
stay indoors; for I very foolishly walked
up town yesterday through the slush,
and caught a bad cold. While I was trying
to keep warm, this evening, a note
was brought me from Mr. Blodgett, asking
me to come to him at once; and fearing
something important, I braved the
cold without delay, ill though I felt. I
was shown at once into his den, which
was so cheerful with its open fire that I
felt it was a good exchange for my cold
room, where I had sat coughing and shivering
all the afternoon.</p>

<p>"Twice in my life I've really lost my
temper with the boss," he began, before
I had even sat down, though he closed
the door while speaking. "Never mind
about the first time, but to-day I got
mad enough to last me for the rest of my
life."</p>

<p>"May I sit down?" I interrupted.</p>

<p>He nodded his head, and took a position
in front of me, with his back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
the fire, as he continued: "Women are
enough to make a man frantic when they
get a fixed idea! Now, to-day, at dinner,
I said I'd invited you, and I saw in a
moment something was in the wind; so
when we had finished I told them to
come in here, and it didn't take me long
to find out the trouble."</p>

<p>"I didn't like to"&mdash;I began; but he
went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And that was the beginning of their
trouble. I tell you, there was Cain here
for about ten minutes, and there weren't
two worse scared women this side of the
grave, while I was ranting; for the boss
remembered the other time, and Agnes
had never seen me break loose. I told
them they'd done their best to drive you
crazy with grief; that if they'd searched
for ten years they couldn't have found
a meaner or crueler thing, or one that
would have hurt you more; that nine
men out of ten, in your shoes, would
have acted dishonestly or cut their throat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
but that you had toed the chalk-line right
along, and never once winced. And I let
them know that for five dollars they'd
added the last straw of pain to a fellow
who deserved only kindness and help
from them."</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Blodgett"&mdash;I protested.</p>

<p>"Hold on. Don't attempt to stop me,
for the fit's on me still," he growled.
"They tried to come the surprised, and
then the offended, but they didn't fool
me. I never let up on them till I had
said all I wanted to say, and they won't
forget it for a day or two. When I sent
Agnes upstairs, she was sobbing her eyes
out, and the boss would have given her
pin money for ten years to have escaped
with her."</p>

<p>"It's too bad to"&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's just what it was!" he cried.
"To think of those screws trying to
blackmail you, and then telling me you
were a skinflint because you wouldn't do
what they wanted! Well, after Agnes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
had gone, I gave the boss a supplementary
and special dose of her own. I told
her she could double discount you on
meanness, and then give you forty-nine
points; and to make sure of good measurement,
I added in the whole female
sex along with her. I told her that if
she knew the facts of your life, she'd get
down on her knees and crawl round to
your place to ask your pardon, and then
she wouldn't be fit to have it. I told
her that when the day of judgment came,
she'd just go the other way in preference
to hearing what the recording angel had
written of her."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that your intended kindness
will make my welcome scantier than
ever."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. I'm the master of
this house, as they found out this afternoon,
and I say who'll come into it, and
who'll not. I shan't need to interfere in
your case, for you'll get a warm welcome
from both."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>"You didn't tell them?" I exclaimed,
starting forward in my seat.</p>

<p>"Not a word, though the boss nearly
went crazy with curiosity. But I did say
that you were making a splendid up-hill
fight, and if they knew the facts of the
case they'd be proud to black your boots.
My word goes in this family about as
well as it does on the Street, and you'll
get all the welcome you can stand from
now on."</p>

<p>"You make me very proud and happy."</p>

<p>"You have reason to be proud," he
asserted. "I'm not a man who slobbers
much, but I'm going to tell you what I
think of you. When you first came here,
I sized you up as rather a softy, your
manner was so quiet and gentle. I got
over that delusion precious quick, and I
want to say that for pluck and grit you're
a trump, and there's my hand on it."</p>

<p>He went to the table, poured out a
couple of glasses of whiskey and seltzer,
and brought them to the fire. "You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
need something for that graveyard cough
of yours," he said, handing one to me.
"Well," he went on, "I didn't bring you
out such a night as this to tell you of my
scrap; but after the row, the boss was so
ashamed of herself that she trumped up
an A 1 excuse (as she thought) for having
treated you as she had, and that led
to a talk, and that's why I sent round
for you. What do you suppose she has
got into her head?"</p>

<p>"I can't imagine."</p>

<p>"I needn't tell you," he remarked,
"that women always know an awful lot
that isn't so. But just because they do,
they every now and then discover a truth
that can't be come at in any other way.
Now the boss thinks she's done this, and
I'm not sure that she hasn't. She says
you are in love."</p>

<p>"I never knew a man who wasn't,"
I replied, trying to smile. "If it isn't
with a woman, then it's always with himself."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>"But the boss thinks she knows the
girl, and has a down on you because you&mdash;because
you don't try for her."</p>

<p>I laughed bitterly, and said, "You
needed no explanation for that."</p>

<p>"That's what made the boss's idea
reasonable to me," he explained. "She
couldn't conceive why you should keep
silent, and so was ready to pitch into
you on the slightest pretense. Women
haven't much use for a man who falls in
love and doesn't say so. But of course
I knew that your debt put marriage out
of the question."</p>

<p>I merely nodded my head, for even to
him I could not speak of my love for
you, it was so sacred to me.</p>

<p>He drew up a chair to the fire, and
continued: "There isn't another man to
whom I'd care to say what I'm going to
say to you, but you've got a heart and a
head both, and won't misunderstand me."
He finished his glass, and set it on the
mantel. "Now I don't have to tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
that the boss is fond of you, and when I
told her that I knew of a reason why you
couldn't marry, she forgave you on the
spot. What's more, she first wished to
learn what it was; and failing in that,
she then wanted to know if it could be
remedied, so that you might have a
chance to win the girl."</p>

<p>"She of course knows nothing of my
position?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "but she knows something
of your character, and she's ordered
me that, if it's possible, I'm to
help you get the girl you care for."</p>

<p>"But my debt!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"How much is it now?" he queried.</p>

<p>"One hundred and eighteen thousand."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll lend Agnes's husband one
hundred and eighteen thousand dollars at
three per cent, and leave her the note
when I die. From what I know of marriage,
I venture to assert that if she
squeezes him for payment it will be his
own fault."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>I sat speechless for a moment, too bewildered
by the unexpected turn to even think.</p>

<p>"I was as surprised as you look," he
went on, "for although I had seen that
you and Agnes"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mr. Blodgett," I exclaimed
hastily, "I am no more to Miss Agnes
than a dozen of her friends! I"&mdash;</p>

<p>"So the boss says," he interrupted.
"But that doesn't mean that you can't
be. Though to speak the truth, my boy,"
he continued, resting his hand on my
knee, "this wasn't my plan. I had
hoped that you and Maizie would take
a shine to each other, and so kiss the
chalk-marks off that old score. But
when I spoke of the scheme to the boss,
this evening, she told me there had never
been a chance of it; that you didn't like
Mai, and that she is practically engaged
to Whitely, and is only&mdash;Better have
some more whiskey, or that cough will
shake you to pieces."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>I could only shake my head in my
misery, but after a moment I was able to
say, "Mr. Blodgett, I did not understand&mdash;I"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I want to tell you," he broke in, "before
you say anything more, that I never
believe in putting one's fingers into love
affairs, and I shouldn't in this case if the
boss didn't feel so keen about it, but I
don't choose to be the one to stand in
her way. And now I'm not offering my
daughter's hand. You know as well as I
that Agnes isn't the kind of girl who
needs a prospectus or a gold clause to
work her off. If she dropped her handkerchief
to-morrow, fifty men would be
scrambling for it, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Then I added, "And, Mr.
Blodgett, I can't find the words to tell
how I thank you both for such a compliment.
If"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I knew you wouldn't misunderstand
me," he went on. "It's a good deal of
a start in life to be born a gentleman."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, Mr. Blodgett," I said, "there
has been a mistake. I&mdash;it is hard to
say, but"&mdash;then I faltered.</p>

<p>He looked at me keenly for a moment.
"So the boss was wrong? It's only
friendship, not love?"</p>

<p>"Just what she has given to me," I
answered.</p>

<p>"Very well. Then if you want to
please the boss&mdash;and me&mdash;let that
friendship grow into something better.
But don't misunderstand me. You must
win Agnes, if she is won. We do nothing."</p>

<p>"Mr. Blodgett, should you be willing
to let me try to win Miss Agnes, if I tell
you that I do not love her as a man
should love the woman he seeks for his
wife?"</p>

<p>"Marriage is a funny business," he
responded. "Now there's the boss.
When I married her I thought she was
so and so; little by little I found she
wasn't; but by the time I had found it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
out I wouldn't have swapped her for
ten of the women I had thought she was.
Some men have no business to marry
unless they're pretty strongly attached,
for they don't run steady; but you're a
fellow that would keep in the traces no
matter what happened, and before long
you'd find yourself mighty fond of Agnes.
A sense of duty is about as good a
basis to marry on, if there's natural sympathy
and liking, as all this ideal make-believe.
I don't think you dislike Agnes,
do you?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, no!" I exclaimed. "Nobody
could. She is too charming and sweet
for any one to do that. Miss Agnes
deserves far more than I can bring her.
What have I to give in return for all
this?"</p>

<p>"You can settle that with Agnes," he
laughed; and then, as if to lessen my
poverty in my own eyes, he kindly added,
"In the first place, I'll get a son-in-law
chock-full of heart and grit and brains;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
and I've had pretty good evidence that
he isn't fortune-hunting, which is Agnes's
great danger. But that isn't all,
and I want you to know I'm not a fool.
I'm a big fellow down in Wall Street,
and even on the Royal Exchange, but do
you think I don't know my position?
They kept me up over two years at the
Philomathean, and you four months.
After you've worked ten years over
books with your own name on them,
you'll be received and kotowed to by
people who wouldn't crook a finger to
know me. You won't be famous as I
am, for the number of naughts I can
write after a figure, but your name will
be known everywhere, and will be familiar
long after mine has been forgotten.
Who were the bankers and rich men fifty
years ago? There isn't one person in a
thousand can tell you. But who hasn't
heard of Thackeray and Hawthorne, Macaulay
and Motley? My girl will have
more money than she'll need; so if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
gets a good husband, and one with reputation,
she can't do better. Don't you
see I'm doing my level best for Agnes,
and making a regular Jew bargain?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps Miss Agnes will not agree."</p>

<p>"We've got to take that chance; but
she likes you, and good women think a
heap more of brains than they do of
money. If you'll let me tell her your
story, it won't be long before she'll take
notice. I shouldn't have had to ask the
boss twice if I'd had any such trump
card as you've got, and she was a sight
less tender-hearted than Agnes!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Blodgett," I said, "I can't tell
you the gratitude I feel, but I must be
frank."</p>

<p>"Hold on!" he cried. "I don't want
you to say anything now. You are to
take a week on it, and not give me your
answer till the end. If you have half
the gratitude in you that you pretend,
you'll do as the boss wants."</p>

<p>I had manned myself to tell him of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
love for you, but I bowed assent, for
indeed, I was too bewildered to think
clearly, and was glad to have a respite.
We shook hands without further parley,
and I came back here, to cough and
shiver while trying to think it all out.
An hour ago I went to bed, but I was
wakeful, and so sit here trying to write
myself into sleepiness.</p>

<p>I have thought out what my course
must be. If it is true, as indeed I know
it to be, that Mr. Whitely has won you,
Mr. Blodgett shall have the truth. I
shall tell him that I will put you out of
my heart, as perforce I must, and that if
he is still willing I will go to Agnes, tell
her too the whole truth, and promise her
such love and devotion as I can give. So
sweet a girl deserves far more, and I cannot
believe that she will accept the little
I can offer; but if she does, it shall be
the labor of my life to be to her a true
and tender husband. And even if she
were not what she is, the thought that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
through her I have made reparation for
the wrong done you will make easy both
tenderness and love for her.</p>

<p>For the last time, perhaps, I have the
right to say, "Good-night, my love."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XXIII" id="XXIII"></a>XXIII</h2>


<p><i>March 14.</i> After dinner this evening
I went to see Mrs. Blodgett; for, miserable
as I felt, my mental suffering was
greater than my physical. The footman
told me she had just gone upstairs to
dress for a ball, but I sent her a message
begging for a moment's interview; and
when he returned, it was to take me to
her boudoir,&mdash;a privilege which would
in itself have shown me how thoroughly
I was forgiven, even if her greeting had
been less warm.</p>

<p>In a few halting and broken sentences
I told her of my love for you. She was
so amazed that at first she seemed unable
to believe me serious; and when
I had persuaded her that I was in earnest,
her perplexity and curiosity were
unbounded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>Why had I behaved so? For what
reason had I never called on Maizie?
Such and many more were the questions
she indignantly poured out, and she only
grew more angry when I answered each
by "I cannot tell you." Finally, in her
irritation, she demanded, "What have
you bothered me for, then?"</p>

<p>"I want you to tell me, if you have
the right, whether Miss Walton is engaged
to Mr. Whitely," I answered.</p>

<p>"Practically," she snapped.</p>

<p>"She has told you so?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you," she replied; adding,
"How do you like your own medicine?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Blodgett," I pleaded, "if you
understood what it means to me to know
the truth, you would not use this to punish
me for what I cannot help. If I
could tell any one the story of my life,
I should tell you; for next to&mdash;to one
other, you are dearer to me than any
living person. If you love me at all, do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
not torture me with a suspense that is
unbearable."</p>

<p>She came and sat down by me on the
lounge, and took my hand, saying, "Mr.
Whitely asked Maizie to marry him four
years ago, but she said she would not
marry a business man. He wouldn't
give up trying, however, though he made
no apparent headway. Indeed, Maizie
told me herself, last spring, just before
she sailed, that she could never love him,
and she was convinced that loveless marriages
were wrong, being sure to end in
unhappiness or sacrifice of one or the
other. So I thought it would come to
nothing. But he persisted, and he's succeeded,
for she told me last week that
she had changed her mind, and was going
to marry him."</p>

<p>"Do you know why she has done so?"
I asked drearily.</p>

<p>"I think it is that book of his. Not
merely is she pleased by the position it's
given him as a writer, but she says it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
convinced her that he is different from
what he appears in society; that no man
but one of noble character and fine mind
could write from such a standpoint."</p>

<p>I sat there dumb and stolid, yet knowing
that all my past suffering had been
as nothing to this new grief. Oh, my
blindness and wickedness! To think, my
darling, that it was I who had aided him
to win you, that my hand had made and
set the trap! Why had I not ended my
wretched existence three years ago, and
so, at least, saved myself from this second
wrong, tenfold worse than that I had
endeavored to mend? For my own selfish
pride and honor, I had juggled, deceived
you, Maizie, the woman dearer to
me than all else, and had myself doomed
you to such a fate.</p>

<p>I suppose I must have shown some of
the agony I felt, for Mrs. Blodgett put
her hand on my shoulder. "Don't take
it so to heart, Rudolph," she begged,
giving me that name for the first time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
"There can still be much true happiness
in your life."</p>

<p>I only kissed her hand in response,
but she instantly pressed her lips on my
forehead. "I am so sorry," she sighed,
"for I had hoped for something very different."</p>

<p>"Mr. Blodgett told me," I answered;
and then I spoke of the resolution I had
come to last night.</p>

<p>When I had finished, she said, "We
won't talk of it any more, Rudolph, for
Agnes' sake as well as yours, but perhaps
by and by, when the suffering is
over, you will come and talk to me again;
for if you ever feel that you can be a
good husband to my girl, I shall not be
afraid to trust her to you, if you can gain
her consent."</p>

<p>I rose to go, and she remarked, "Yes.
You mustn't stay, for as it is, my dressing
will make us very late. If the carriage
is at the door, tell Maxwell to drive
you home, and then return for us. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
mustn't walk in the slush with that horrid
cough of yours. Does your landlady
give you blankets enough? Well, tell
her to make a steaming glass of whiskey
toddy. Wrap some woolen round your
throat and chest, and go straight to bed.
Why, Rudolph, you are not going without
kissing me good-night?" she continued,
as if that had been my habit, adding,
"Some day I shall make you tell me
all about it."</p>

<p>I went downstairs, intending to follow
her directions; but as I passed the drawing-room
door I heard the piano, and
thought I recognized, from the touch,
whose fingers were straying at random
over the keys.</p>

<p>"Isn't that Miss Walton?" I asked
of the servant, as he brought me my hat
and coat.</p>

<p>"Yes, Dr. Hartzmann. Miss Walton
is to go to the ball with the ladies, and is
waiting for them to come downstairs,"
he told me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>I left him holding my coat, and passed
noiselessly between the curtains of the
portière. Your back was turned to me
as you sat at the instrument, and I stood
in silence watching you as you played,
till suddenly&mdash;was it sympathy, or only
the consciousness of something alien?&mdash;you
looked around. I should almost think
it was the former, for you expressed no
surprise at seeing me standing there, even
though you rose.</p>

<p>"Don't let me interrupt you," I begged.</p>

<p>"I was only beguiling the time I have
to wait," you replied.</p>

<p>"It will be a favor to me if you will
go on," I said, and without another word,
with that simple grace and sweetness
natural to you, you resumed your seat
and went on playing, while I sat down
on the divan.</p>

<p>Your bent, like mine, was for some
reason a sad one, and what you played
reflected your mood, stirring me deeply
and making me almost forget my misery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
Presently, however, I was seized with a
paroxysm of coughing; and when I had
recovered enough to be conscious of anything,
I found you standing by me, looking
both startled and compassionate.</p>

<p>"You are ill, Dr. Hartzmann," you
said, anxiously.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," I managed to articulate.</p>

<p>"Can I do anything for you?" you
asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing," I replied, rising, more
wretched than ever, because knowing
how little I deserved your sympathy.</p>

<p>"It would be a pleasure to help you,
Dr. Hartzmann, for I have never been
able to show any gratefulness for your
kindness over my book," you went on,
with a touch of timidity in your tones, as
if you were asking a favor rather than
conferring one.</p>

<p>Won by your manner, before I knew
what I was doing, I spoke. "Miss Walton,"
I burst out, "you see before you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
the most miserable being conceivable, and
you can save me from the worst anguish
I am suffering!"</p>

<p>Your eyes enlarged in surprise, both
at my vehemence and at what I had uttered,
while you stood looking at me,
with slightly parted lips; then you said
sweetly, "Tell me what I can do for
you."</p>

<p>I had spoken without thought, only
conscious that I must try in some way
to save you. For a moment I hesitated,
and then exclaimed, "I beg of you not to
marry Mr. Whitely!"</p>

<p>Like a goddess you drew yourself up,
even before you could have appreciated
the full import of my foolish speech, and
never have I seen you look more beautiful
or queenly than as you faced me.
After a brief silence you answered, "You
can hardly realize what you are saying,
Dr. Hartzmann."</p>

<p>"I am indeed mad in my unhappiness,"
I groaned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>"You owe me an explanation for your
extraordinary words," you continued.</p>

<p>"Miss Walton," I said, "Mr. Whitely
is not a man to make you happy, and in
hopes of saving you from him I spoke as
I did. I had no right, as none can know
better than myself, but perhaps you will
forgive the impertinence when I say that
my motive was only to save you from
future misery."</p>

<p>"Why should I not be happy in marrying
Mr. Whitely?"</p>

<p>"Because you are deceiving yourself
about him."</p>

<p>"In what respect?"</p>

<p>"His character is other than you think
it."</p>

<p>"Be more specific."</p>

<p>"That I cannot be."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"It would be dishonorable in me."</p>

<p>"Not more so than to stop where you
have."</p>

<p>"I cannot say more."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not recognize your right to be
silent. You have said too much or too
little."</p>

<p>"Maizie," called Mrs. Blodgett from
the hall, "come quickly, for we are very
late."</p>

<p>"I shall insist, at some future time,
upon your speaking more clearly, Dr.
Hartzmann," you said, as a queen would
speak, and picking up your wrap, without
a parting word, you left me standing
in the middle of the drawing-room.</p>

<p>I came home through the cold, and
have sat here regretting my foolishness
and groping for the right course to pursue.
Oh, my darling, if I but had the
right, I would gladly tell you the whole
story of the miserable deception, even
though I disgraced myself in your eyes.
If it were merely my own honor which
was at stake, I should not hesitate for an
instant, but would sacrifice it to save you,
though self-respect seems now the only
thing left me. But try as I may to prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
to myself that I have the right, I cannot,
for I feel that more than my own honor
is concerned. I have taken Mr. Whitely's
money, and cannot return it to him.
To break faith would be worse than
despicable. I shall speak to you of my
employer's hardness, and beg you to ask
Mr. Blodgett if he would give Agnes to
Mr. Whitely or advise you to marry him.
My heart yearns to aid you in your peril,
but I can think of nothing more that I
can do. May God do what I cannot, my
dearest. Good-night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XXIV" id="XXIV"></a>XXIV</h2>

<p><i>March 15.</i> I was so miserable with
my cough to-day that I could not summon
the energy to drag myself to Mr. Blodgett's
office, and did not leave my room
till after eight, when your note came.</p>

<p>"Miss Walton," it read, "feels that she
has the right to request Dr. Hartzmann
to call this evening, in relation to the
conversation uncompleted last night."</p>

<p>I understood the implied command, and
thought that I owed what you claimed,
while feeling that in obeying I could for
this once forego my scruple of entering
your door. The footman showed me into
the library, and left me there. It was
the first time I had seen it since my thirteenth
year, and I cannot tell you the
moment's surprise and joy I felt on finding
it absolutely unchanged. Even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
books were arranged as formerly, and my
eye searched and found, as quickly as of
yore, all the old volumes full of plates
which had once given us such horror and
delight. For the instant I forgot my
physical suffering and the coming ordeal.</p>

<p>When you entered the room, you welcomed
me only with a bow. Then seeing
my paleness, you said kindly, "I forgot
your cough, Dr. Hartzmann, or I
would not have brought you out in such
weather. Sit here by the fire." After a
short pause you went on: "I hope that
a day's thought has convinced you that
common justice requires you to say more
than you did last night?"</p>

<p>"Miss Walton," I replied, "to you,
who know nothing of the difficult and
hopeless position in which I stand, my
conduct, I presume, seems most dishonorable
and cowardly; yet I cannot say
more than I said last night."</p>

<p>"You must."</p>

<p>"I can scarcely hope that what I then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
said will influence you, but if you will go
to Mr. Blodgett and"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Does Mr. Blodgett know what you
object to in Mr. Whitely?" you interrupted.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I went to Mr. Blodgett this morning,
and he told me that he knew of no reason
why I should not marry Mr. Whitely."</p>

<p>"Then, Miss Walton," I answered, rising,
"I cannot expect that you will be
influenced by my opinion. I will withdraw
what I said last night. Think of
me as leniently as you can, for my purpose
was honorable."</p>

<p>"But you ought to say more. You"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I cannot," I replied.</p>

<p>"You have no right to"&mdash;But here
a servant entered, with a card.</p>

<p>"Dr. Hartzmann," you announced,
when the man had gone, "I wrote Mr.
Whitely yesterday afternoon, asking him
to call this evening, with the intention
of accepting his offer of marriage. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
is now in the drawing-room, and unless
you will have the fairness, the honesty,
to explain what you meant, I shall tell
him all that has occurred, and give him
the opportunity to force you to speak."</p>

<p>"I shall only repeat to him, Miss Walton,
what I have said to you."</p>

<p>You stood a moment looking at me,
with a face blazing with indignation;
then you exclaimed, "You at least owe it
to him not to run away while I am gone!"
and passed into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>You returned very soon, followed by
Mr. Whitely.</p>

<p>"Dr. Hartzmann," you asked, "will
you repeat what you said last night to
me?"</p>

<p>"I advised you not to marry Mr.
Whitely, Miss Walton."</p>

<p>"And you will not say why?" you demanded.</p>

<p>"I cannot."</p>

<p>"Mr. Whitely," you cried, "cannot
you force him to speak?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Walton," he replied suavely,
and his very coolness in the strange condition
made me feel that he was master
of the situation, "I am as perplexed as
you are at this extraordinary conduct in
one who even now is eating bread from
my hand. I have long since ceased to
expect gratitude for benefits, but such
malevolence surprises and grieves me,
since I have never done Dr. Hartzmann
any wrong, but, on the contrary, I have
always befriended him."</p>

<p>"I have been in the employ of Mr.
Whitely," I answered, "but every dollar
he has paid me has been earned by my
labor. I owe him no debt of gratitude
that he does not owe me."</p>

<p>"You owe him the justice that every
man owes another," you asserted indignantly.
"To make vague charges behind
one's back, and then refuse to be
explicit, is a coward's and a slanderer's
way of waging war."</p>

<p>"Miss Walton," I cried, "I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
not have spoken, though God knows that
my motive was only a wish to do you a
service, and I would give my life to do as
you ask!"</p>

<p>For an instant my earnestness seemed
to sway you; indeed, I am convinced
that this was so, since Mr. Whitely apparently
had the same feeling, and spoke
as if to neutralize my influence, saying to
you: "Miss Walton, I firmly believe that
Dr. Hartzmann's plea of honorable conduct
is nothing but the ambush of a coward.
But as he has been for two years
in the most intimate and confidential position
of private secretary to me, he may,
through some error, have deluded himself
into a conviction that gives a basis
for his indefinite charges. I will not
take advantage of the implied secrecy,
and I say to him in your presence that if
he has discovered anything which indicates
that I have been either impure or
criminal, I give him permission to speak."</p>

<p>Even in that moment of entanglement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
I could not but admire and marvel at
the skill with which he had phrased his
speech, so as to seem absolutely open, to
slur me by innuendo, and yet avoid the
risk of exposure. It left me helpless, and
I could only say, "I have not charged
Mr. Whitely with either impurity or criminality."</p>

<p>You turned to him and said, "This
conduct is perfectly inexplicable."</p>

<p>"Except on one ground," he replied.</p>

<p>"Which is?" you questioned.</p>

<p>"That Dr. Hartzmann loves you," he
answered.</p>

<p>"That is impossible!" you exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Not as impossible as for a man not
to love you, Miss Walton," he averred.</p>

<p>"Tell Mr. Whitely how mistaken he
is," you said to me.</p>

<p>I could only stand silent, and after
waiting a little Mr. Whitely remarked,
"You see!"</p>

<p>"It is incredible!" you protested.
"You must deny it, Dr. Hartzmann!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>"I cannot, Miss Walton," I murmured,
with bowed head.</p>

<p>"You love me?" you cried incredulously.</p>

<p>"I love you," I assented, and in spite
of the circumstances it was happiness to
say it to you.</p>

<p>You stood gazing at me in amazement,
large-eyed as a startled deer. I wonder
what your first words would have been
to me if Mr. Whitely had not turned
your mind into another channel by saying,
"I do not think that we need search
further for Dr. Hartzmann's motives in
making his innuendoes."</p>

<p>"Miss Walton," I urged, "my love for
you, far from making your faith in me
less or my motive that of a rival, should
convince you that I spoke only for your
sake, since you yourself know that my
love has been neither hopeful nor self-seeking."</p>

<p>I think you pitied me, for you answered
gently, and all traces of the scorn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
and indignation you had shown just
before were gone from your face and
manner.</p>

<p>"Dr. Hartzmann," you said, "I cannot
allow myself to listen to or weigh
such indefinite imputations against Mr.
Whitely. I will give you one week to
explain or substantiate what you have
implied; and unless within that time you
do so, I shall accept the offer of marriage
which he has honored me by making.
Do not let me detain you further.
Good-evening."</p>

<p>I passed out of the room a broken-hearted
man, without strength enough to
hold up my head, and hardly able in my
weakness to crawl back to my study. As
I sit and write, every breath brings with
it the feeling that a knife is being thrust
into my breast, and I am faint with the
pain. But for this racking cough and
burning fever I might have made a better
fight, and have been able to think of
some way of saving you. But even in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
my suffering I have reached one conclusion.
To-morrow I shall go to Mr.
Whitely and tell him that you must
know the truth concerning the book, and
that if he will not tell you I shall. I
shall never be able to hold up my head
again; but that is nothing, if I can but
save you. Oh, my dearest love, the sacrifice
of life, of honor, the meeting ignominy
or death for your sake, will be
nothing to me but hap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p><i>January 10, 1895.</i> This evening I
have for the first time re-read this&mdash;I
know not what to call it, for it is neither
diary nor letter&mdash;the story of my love;
and as I read, the singular sensation
came over me that I was following, not
my own thoughts and experiences, but
those of another man. Five years ago,
half mad with grief, and physically and
nervously exhausted to the brink of a
breakdown, I spent my evenings writing
my thoughts, in the hope that the fatigue
of the task would bring the sleep I sought
in vain. Little I then wrote seems to me
now, in my new life, what I could ever
possibly have confided to paper, much
less have felt. Yet here is my own handwriting
to vouch for every word, and to
tell me that the morbid chronicle is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
other than my own. I cannot believe
that mere years have brought so startling
a mental change, and I therefore think
that much of it is an expression, not of
myself, but of the illness which put an
end to my writing. If proof were needed
of the many kinds of men each man contains,
this manuscript of mine would furnish
it; for the being I have read about
this evening is no more the Donald Maitland
of to-night than&mdash;Ah, well, to my
task of telling what has wrought this
change, since it must be written.</p>

<p>For a month I was confined to my
bed with pneumonia, and the attack so
weakened me that I did not leave my
room for five weeks more. During that
time Mrs. Blodgett's kindness was constant,
and her face is the only memory
that stands out from the hours of my
acute torture. While I was convalescing,
she came once, and sometimes twice, each
day, bringing me flowers, fruit, jellies,
wines, and whatever else her love could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
suggest. It was amusing to see her
domineer over the doctor, trained nurse,
and landlady, and I soon learned to
whom to make my pleas for extra liberty
or special privileges. No request,
however whimsical, seemed too much for
her affection, though my demands were
unceasing, in the selfishness of my invalidism.
Only one thing I dared not ask
her, and that was not from fear that it
would be refused, but from cowardice.
I longed to have her speak of you, but
during those weeks she never mentioned
your name.</p>

<p>The day before Mrs. Blodgett left town
she took me for my first airing in her
carriage, and told me that she was leaving
a man and horses in town for a
month longer in order that I should have
a daily drive. "Mr. Blodgett really
needs a carriage more in the summer
than he does in the winter, but he never
will consent to let me leave one for him,
so I've used you as an excuse," was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
way she explained her kindness. "By
the end of the month I hope you will
be well enough to come up and make us
a visit in the Berkshires, for the change
will be the very best thing for you."</p>

<p>"I hope to be at work again by that
time," I said.</p>

<p>"You are not to see pen or paper till
the first of October!" she ordered; and
when I only shook my head, she continued,
"For three years you've been
overworking yourself, and now the doctor
says you must take a long rest, and
I'm going to see that you have it."</p>

<p>"You mean to be good to me, Mrs.
Blodgett," I sighed, "but if you knew
my situation, you would understand that
I must get to work again as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"I don't care about your situation,"
she sniffed contemptuously, "and I do
care about your health. I shall insist
that you come up to My Fancy, if I have
to come back to the city to bring you;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
and when I once get you there, I shan't
let you go away till I choose."</p>

<p>Loving my tyrant, I did not protest
further, though firm in my own mind as
to my duty. As it turned out, I need
not have denied her, for the end of the
month found me with but little added
strength; and though I tried to work
two or three times, I was forced to abandon
the attempts without accomplishing
anything. My wonder is that I gained
strength at all, in my discouragement
over the loss of Mr. Whitely's work, my
three months' idleness, the heavy doctor's
bills, and the steadily accruing interest
on the debt.</p>

<p>On the 21st of June Mr. Blodgett came
to see me, as indeed he had done daily
since Mrs. Blodgett left town.</p>

<p>"The boss writes," he announced,
"ordering me to come up to-day, and
directing that before I leave New York
I am to do forty-seven things, ranging
in importance from buying her the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
novels to matching some white"&mdash;he
looked at his letter, and spelled out&mdash;"'f-l-o-s-s'
as per sample inclosed. I
haven't time to do more than forty-five,
and I'm afraid I'll never hear the last
of the remaining two unless you'll save
me."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Well, three times in her letter she
tells me that I've got to bring you, the
last time as good as saying that my life
won't be an insurable risk if I don't.
Since she puts so much stress on your
presence, it's just possible that if I fill
that order she'll forget the rest."</p>

<p>"I would go, Mr. Blodgett, but"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, I understand all that," he interrupted.
"Of course, if you stay in the
cool fresh air of the city, you won't run
any risk of the malaria the Berkshires
are full of; I know the New York markets
have peas as large and firm as bullets,
while those in our garden are poor
little shriveled affairs hardly worth the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
trouble of eating; our roads are not
Belgian blocks, but only soft dirt, and we
haven't got a decent flagged sidewalk
within ten miles of My Fancy. I understand
perfectly that you'll get well
faster here, and so get to work sooner;
but all the same, just as a favor, you
might pull me out of this scrape."</p>

<p>I need not say I had to yield, and together
we took the afternoon express.
On the train we found Mr. Whitely,&mdash;as
great a surprise, apparently, to Mr.
Blodgett as it was to me.</p>

<p>"Hello!" exclaimed the banker.
"Where are you bound for?"</p>

<p>"I presume for the same destination
you are," Mr. Whitely replied. "I am
going up to see Miss Walton, and if Mrs.
Blodgett cannot give me a night's hospitality,
I shall go to the hotel."</p>

<p>"Plenty of room at My Fancy, and
I'll guarantee your welcome," promised
Mr. Blodgett pleasantly. "Here's the
doctor going up for a bit of nursing."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>Much to my surprise, my former employer
entered the compartment, and,
offering me his hand, sat down by the
lounge I was stretched upon. "You've
had a serious illness," he remarked, with
a bland attempt at sympathy.</p>

<p>I only nodded my head.</p>

<p>"I hope you will recover quickly, for
you are needed in the office," he went on.</p>

<p>I could not have been more surprised
if he had struck me, though I did not
let it appear in my face.</p>

<p>"Whitely's been trying to go it alone
on his editorials, and the papers have all
been laughing at him," chuckled Mr.
Blodgett. "Just read us your famous
one, Whitely,&mdash;that one about The Tendency
of Modern Art, with the original
Hebrew from Solomon you put in."</p>

<p>I saw my employer redden, and in
pity for his embarrassment I said, "I do
not think I shall ever come back to the
office, Mr. Whitely."</p>

<p>"Why not?" he exclaimed. "You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
committed an unwise action, but business
is business, and I see no cause why we
need let a single mistake terminate a relation
mutually profitable."</p>

<p>"I have learned the lesson that one
cannot sell one's honesty without wronging
other people, and I shall never do it
again."</p>

<p>"This is purely sentimental"&mdash;he
began.</p>

<p>Mr. Blodgett, however, interrupted by
saying, "Now don't go to exciting the
doctor, for he's to sleep on the trip. Besides,
I've got something in mind better
than the job he's had under you,
Whitely. Come and have a smoke, and
leave him to nap a bit."</p>

<p>They left me, and I set to puzzling
over many questions: how you would
greet me at My Fancy; how you would
welcome Mr. Whitely; what was the
meaning of his friendliness towards me;
and what new kindness Mr. Blodgett had
in store for me. Finally I fell asleep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
to be awakened only when we reached
our destination.</p>

<p>Agnes met us at the station, and at
the house Mrs. Blodgett gave me the
warmest of welcomes, but not till I came
downstairs before dinner did you and I
meet. Your greeting was formal, yet
courteous and gracious as of old, almost
making me question if our last two interviews
could be realities.</p>

<p>Before the dinner was finished Mrs.
Blodgett ordered me to the divan on the
veranda, and sent dessert and fruit out
to me. You all joined me when the moment
came for coffee and cigars; but the
evening was cloudy and rather breezy,
and presently Mrs. Blodgett said it was
too cold for her, and suggested a game
of whist indoors. "You must stay out
here," she told me, "but if you feel cool
be sure to use the shawl."</p>

<p>You turned and said to Mr. Whitely,
"You will play, I hope?" and he assented
so eagerly that it was all I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
do to keep from laughing outright when
you continued, "Agnes and Mr. Whitely
will make your table, Mrs. Blodgett, so
I will stay here and watch the clouds."
The whole thing was so palpably with
an object that I felt at once that you
wished to see me alone, to learn if I had
anything more to say concerning Mr.
Whitely; and as I realized this, I braced
myself for the coming ordeal.</p>

<p>For a few moments you stood watching
the gathering storm, and then took
a chair by the divan on which I lay.</p>

<p>"Are you too honorable," you began,&mdash;and
though I could not see your face
in the darkness, your voice told me you
were excited,&mdash;"to pardon dishonorable
conduct in others? For I have come to
beg of you forgiveness for a wrong."</p>

<p>"Of me, Miss Walton?"</p>

<p>"Last April," you went on, "Mrs.
Blodgett brought me a book and asked
me to read it. A few paragraphs revealed
to me that it was something written by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
an old friend of mine. After reading a
little further, I realized for the first time
that I was violating a confidence. Yet
though I knew this, and struggled to close
the book, I could not, but read it to the
end. Can you forgive me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Walton!" I protested.
"Why ask forgiveness of me? What is
your act compared to the wrong"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hush, Don," you said gently, and
your use of my name, so long unheard,
told me in a word that the feeling of
our childhood days was come again.
"Tell me you forgive me!" you entreated.</p>

<p>"I am not the one to forgive, Maizie."</p>

<p>"I did wrong, and I ask your pardon,"
you begged humbly. "Yet I'm
not sorry in the least, and I should do
it again," you instantly added, laughing
merrily at your own perverseness. Then
in a moment you were serious again,
saying, "I never received the letters or
the photograph, Donald. My uncle con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>fesses
that he put them in the fire."
And before I could speak, a new thought
seized you, for you continued sadly, "I
shall never forgive myself for my harshness
and cruelty when you were so ill."</p>

<p>"That is nothing," I replied, "since
all our misunderstandings are gone.
Why, even my debt, Maizie, ceases now
to be a burden; in the future it will be
only a joy to work."</p>

<p>"Donald!" you exclaimed. "You
don't suppose I shall let you pay me another
cent!"</p>

<p>"I must."</p>

<p>"But I am rich," you protested. "The
money is nothing to me. You shall not
ruin your career to pay it. I scorn myself
when I think that I refused to see
you that night, and so lost my only
chance of saving you from what followed.
My cowardice, my wicked cowardice! It
drove you to death's door by overwork,
to give me wealth I do not know how to
spend. You parted with your library that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
I might let money lie idle in bank. I
forced you to sell your book&mdash;your
fame&mdash;to that thief. Oh, Donald, think
of the wrong it has done already, and
don't make it do greater!"</p>

<p>"Maizie, you do not understand"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I understand it all," you interrupted.
"You must not&mdash;you shall not&mdash;I
won't take it&mdash;I"&mdash;</p>

<p>"For his sake!"</p>

<p>"But I love him, too!" you pleaded.
"Don't you see, Donald, that it was
never the money,&mdash;that was nothing;
but they told me his love&mdash;and yours,
for they said you had known all the time&mdash;was
only pretense, a method by which
you might continue to rob me. And I
came to believe it,&mdash;though I should
have known better,&mdash;because, since you
never wrote, it seemed to me you had
both dropped me out of your thoughts
as soon as you could no longer plunder
me. Even then, scorning you,&mdash;like
you in your feeling over my neglect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
your letters,&mdash;I could not help loving
you, for those Paris and Tyrol days
were the happiest I have ever known;
and though I knew, Don, that I ought
to forget you, as I believed you had forgotten
me, I could not do so. I have
never dared to speak in public of either
of you, for fear I should break down. Try
as I might, I could not help loving you
both as I have never loved any one else.
That I turned you away from my house
was because I did not dare to meet you,&mdash;I
knew I could not control myself.
After the man took the message, I sobbed
over having to insult you by sending it by
a servant. But for my want of courage&mdash;had
I seen you as I ought&mdash;If I had
only understood, as your journal has made
me,&mdash;had only known that my name was
on his lips when he died! No money
could pay for what he gave to me. Could
he ask me now for twice the sum, it
would be my pleasure to give it to him,
for I love him dearly, and"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you love him, Maizie, you will let
me clear his name as far as lies within
my power."</p>

<p>For an instant you were silent, and
then said softly, "You are right, Donald,
we will clear his name."</p>

<p>I took your hand and touched it to my
lips. "To hear you speak of him"&mdash;I
could go no further, in my emotion.</p>

<p>There was a pause before you asked,
"Donald, do you remember our talk here
last autumn?"</p>

<p>"Every word."</p>

<p>You laughed gayly. "I want you to
know, sir," you asserted, with a pretense
of defiance, "that I don't believe in love,
because I have never found any that was
wholly free from self-indulgence or self-interest.
And I still think"&mdash;</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Blodgett joined us, and
inquired, "Have you told Rudolph, Maizie?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I went to see how you were the mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>ment
I heard of your illness," she said,
with a certain challenge in her voice,
"and I found that book lying on your
desk just where you stopped writing
from weakness. I read it, and I took it
to Maizie."</p>

<p>"It was kismet, I suppose," was all I
could say, too happy to think of criticism,
and instantly her manner changed and
she wiped her eyes.</p>

<p>"I had to do it," she sobbed.</p>

<p>"You have been too good to me," I
answered, rising and taking her hand.</p>

<p>"There, there," she continued, steadying
herself. "I didn't come out to behave
like this, but to tell you to go to
bed at once. I'm going to your room
to see that everything is right for our invalid,
but don't you delay a minute after
I'm gone," and she disappeared through
the doorway.</p>

<p>I turned to you and held out my
hand, bidding you, "Good-night, Maizie,"
and you took it, and replied, "Good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>night,
Don." Then suddenly you leaned
forward, and, kissing my forehead, added,
"God keep you safe for me, my darling."</p>

<p>I took you in my arms, and gave you
back your kiss twofold, while saying,
"Good-night, my love."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>A man does not willingly spread on
paper the sweetest and tenderest moments
of his life. When half crazed
with grief and illness I might express
my suffering, much as, in physical pain,
some groan aloud; but the deepest happiness
is silent, for it is too great to
be told. And lest, my dears, you think
me even less manly than I am, I choose
to add here the reason for my writing
the last few pages of this story of my
love, that if you ever read it you may
know the motive which made me tell
what till to-night I have kept locked in
my heart.</p>

<p>This evening the dearest woman in the
world came to me, as I sat at my desk
in the old library, and asked, "Are you
busy, Donald?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am reading the one hundred and
forty-seventh complimentary review of
my History of the Moors, and I am so
sick of sweets that your interruption
comes as an unalloyed pleasure."</p>

<p>"Am I bitter or acid?" she asked,
leaning over my shoulder and arranging
my hair, which is one of her ways of
pleasing me.</p>

<p>"You are my exact opposite," I said
gravely.</p>

<p>"How uncomplimentary you are!"
she cried, with a pretense of anger in her
voice.</p>

<p>"An historian must tell the truth now
and then, for variety's sake."</p>

<p>"Then tell me if you are too engaged
to spare me a minute. Any other time
will do."</p>

<p>"You are seriously mistaken, because
no other time will do. And nothing
about me is ever engaged, as regards
you, except my affections, and they are
permanently so."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've come to ask a great favor of
you."</p>

<p>"Out of the question; but you may
tell me what it is."</p>

<p>"Ah, Donald, say you will grant it
before I tell you?"</p>

<p>"Concealment bespeaks a guilty conscience."</p>

<p>"But sometimes you are so funny and
obstinate about things!"</p>

<p>"That is what Mr. Whitely used to
say."</p>

<p>"Don't mention that wretch's name
to me! To think of that miserable little
Western college making him an LL. D.
because of your book!"</p>

<p>"Never mind, Maizie; here's a letter
I received an hour ago from Jastrow,
which tells me the University of Leipzig
is going to give me a degree."</p>

<p>"That he should steal your fame!"</p>

<p>"My Moor is five times the chap my
Turk was."</p>

<p>"But you might have had both!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>"And gone without you? Don't fret
over it, my darling."</p>

<p>"I can't help"&mdash;</p>

<p>She always ends this vein by abusing
herself, which I wouldn't allow another
human being to do, and which I don't
like to hear, so I interrupted: "Jastrow
says he'll come over in March to visit
us, and threatens to bring the manuscript
of his whole seventeen volumes,
for me to take a final look at it before
he sends it to press."</p>

<p>"The dear old thing!" she said tenderly.
"I love him so for what he was
to you that I believe I shall welcome him
with a kiss."</p>

<p>"Why make the rest of his life unhappy?"</p>

<p>"Is that the way it affects you?"</p>

<p>"Woman is born illogical, and even
the cleverest of her sex cannot entirely
overcome the taint. After you give me
a kiss I bear in mind that I am to have
another, and that makes me very happy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
But if you kiss Jastrow, the poor fellow
will go back to Germany and pine away
into his grave. Even his fifty-two dialects
will not satisfy him after your labial."</p>

<p>"Oh, you silly!" she exclaimed; but,
my dears, I think she is really, in her
secret heart, fond of silliness, for she
leaned over and&mdash;There, I'll stop being
what she called me.</p>

<p>"We'll give him a great reception,"
she continued, "and have every one
worth knowing to meet him."</p>

<p>"He is the shyest of beings."</p>

<p>"How books and learning do refine
men!" she said.</p>

<p>"I am afraid they do make weaklings
of us."</p>

<p>"Will you never get over the idea
that you are weak?" she cried; for it
is one of her pet superstitions that I am
not.</p>

<p>"You'll frighten me out of it if you
speak like that."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are&mdash;well&mdash;that is really
what I came to ask for. Just to please
your own wife, you will, Donald, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"The distinction between 'will' and
'won't' is clearly set forth in a somewhat
well-known song concerning a spider and
a fly."</p>

<p>"Oh, you bad boy!"</p>

<p>"Adsum."</p>

<p>"I'm really serious."</p>

<p>"I never was less so."</p>

<p>"I should not have become your wife
if I had dreamed you would be such a
brute!"</p>

<p>"You'll please remember that I never
asked you to marry me."</p>

<p>She laughed deliciously over the insult,
and after that I could not resist
her.</p>

<p>"You have," I said, "a bundle in
your left hand, wrapped in tissue paper
and tied with a blue ribbon, which you
sedulously keep from my sight, but of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
which I caught a glimpse as you entered."</p>

<p>"And you've known it all this time!
Perhaps you know too what I want?"</p>

<p>"Last spring," I answered, "I knocked
at the door of your morning-room twice,
and receiving no response, I went in, to
find you reading something that you instantly
hid from sight. There were on
the lounge, I remember, a sheet of tissue
paper and a blue ribbon. I suspect a
connection."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"My theory is that you have some
really improper book wrapped in the
paper, and that is why you so guiltily
hide it from me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Donald, it gives me such happiness
to read it!"</p>

<p>"That was the reason I asked you
why you had tears in your eyes, when I
surprised you that day. Your happiness
was most enviable!"</p>

<p>"Men never understand women!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>"Deo gratias."</p>

<p>"But I love it."</p>

<p>"I don't like to hear you express such
sentiments for so erotic a book."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't apply such a word to it!"
she cried, in a pained voice.</p>

<p>"A word," I explained, "taken from
the Greek <i>erotikos</i>, which is derived from
<i>erao</i>, meaning 'I love passionately.' It
is singularly descriptive, Maizie."</p>

<p>"If it means that, I like it, but I
thought you were insulting my book."</p>

<p>"Almost five years ago," I remarked,
"a volume was stolen from my room,
which I have never since been able to
recover. Now a woman of excessive
honesty calmly calls it hers."</p>

<p>"You know you don't want it."</p>

<p>"I want it very much."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"To put it in the fire."</p>

<p>"Don!"</p>

<p>"Once upon a time a most bewitching
woman wrote a story, and in a vain mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>ment
her husband asked her to give it
to him. She"&mdash;</p>

<p>"But, my darling, it was so foolish
that I had to burn it up. Think of my
making the heroine marry that creature!"</p>

<p>"Since you married the poor chap to
the other girl, there was no other ending
possible. If the book were only in existence,
I think Agnes and her husband
would enjoy reading it almost as much
as I should."</p>

<p>"How silly I was! But at least the
book made you write the ending which
prevented me from accepting him that
winter. What a lot of trouble I gave my
poor dear!"</p>

<p>"I met the 'poor dear' yesterday,
looking very old and unhappy despite his
LL. D."</p>

<p>"Oh, you idiot!" she laughed. And
she must like imbeciles, too, for&mdash;well,
I'm not going to tell even you how I
know that she's fond of idiots.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why do you suppose he's unhappy?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"My theory is that he's miserable because
he lost&mdash;lost me."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad he is!" joyously asserted
the tenderest of women.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," I resumed, "it was a
book I should have valued as much as
you do that one in tissue paper, and you
ought not to have burned it."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry I did, Donald, since
you would really have liked it," she said,
wistfully and sorrowfully. "I should
have thought of your feelings, and not of
mine."</p>

<p>This is a mood I cannot withstand.
"Dear heart," I responded, "I have you,
and all the books in the world are not
worth a breath in comparison. What
favor do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"To write a sort of last chapter&mdash;an
ending, you know&mdash;telling about&mdash;about
the rest."</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten it?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>

<p>"I? Never! I couldn't. But I want
to have it all in the book, so that when
Foster and Mai are older they can read
it."</p>

<p>"I have no intention of sharing, even
with our children, my under-the-rose idyl
with the loveliest of girls. And when
the children are older, they'll be far
more interested in their own heart secrets
than they are in ours."</p>

<p>"Still, dear," she pleaded, "they may
hear from others some unkind and perverted
allusions to our story; for you
know what foolish things were said at
the time of our marriage."</p>

<p>"If I remember rightly, some one&mdash;was
it my mother or Mr. Whitely?"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Both," she answered.</p>

<p>"&mdash;spread it abroad that I had trapped
an heiress into marriage by means of an
alias."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it a delicious version!" she
laughed merrily. "But no matter what's
ever tattled in the future, if Foster and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
Mai have your journal, they will always
understand it."</p>

<p>"Maizie," I urged, "if you let those
imps of mischief read of our childish
doings in this old library, they'll either
finish painting the plates in Kingsborough,
or burn the house down in trying
to realize an Inca of Peru at the stake."</p>

<p>"But I won't read them those parts,"
she promised; "especially if you write a
nice ending, which they'll like."</p>

<p>"Won't it do to add just a paragraph,
saying that our fairy godmamma found
and gave you the journal, and that then
we 'lived happily ever after'?"</p>

<p>"No, Donald," she begged. "I want
the whole story, to match the rest."</p>

<p>"Five years ago I knew the saddest
and most dejected of fellows, whose misery
was so great that he wailed it out on
paper. But now I know only the happiest
of mortals, and he cannot write in the
lugubrious tone of yore&mdash;unless a lady
of his acquaintance will banish him from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
her presence or do something else equally
joy-destroying."</p>

<p>"Are you trying to bribe me into giving
you a rest from my presence for a
time?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," I assented. "It's a
fearful strain to live up to you, and it is
beginning to tell on me."</p>

<p>"If I didn't know you were teasing, I
should really be hurt. But I should like
to ask you one thing."</p>

<p>"And that is?"</p>

<p>"In your journal&mdash;well&mdash;of course I
know that you were&mdash;that I am not&mdash;that
your love made you think me what
I never was in the least, Donald," she
faltered, "but still, perhaps&mdash;Do you
remember what Mr. Blodgett said about
his not giving Mrs. Blodgett for ten of
the women he&mdash;? I hope you like my
reality as much as your ideal."</p>

<p>"Haven't you changed your idea of
me, Maizie?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p>"And therefore you don't love me as
much?"</p>

<p>"But that's different, Donald," she
observed seriously.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Why, you treated me so strangely
that, inevitably, I didn't know what you
were like; and though you interested
me very much, and though your journal
brought back my old love for you, still,
what I did was more in pity and admiration
and reparation than&mdash;and so I
could fall deeper in love. While you,
being so much in love already, and with
such a totally different woman"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Only went from bad to worse," I
groaned. "Yes, I own up. My sin is
one of the lowest man can commit. I
have fallen in love with a married woman.
And the strange thing about it is that
you are not jealous of her! Indeed, I
really believe that you are magnanimous
enough to love her too, though it's natural
you should not like her as much as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
you do some others. But next August
I'll leave her and go to India to study
for my new book."</p>

<p>"The married woman will go too,"
she predicted calmly.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't dare risk her among
those hill tribes."</p>

<p>"And she won't risk you where it
isn't safe for her to go."</p>

<p>"I was only thinking of your lovely
complexion," I explained.</p>

<p>"Old mahogany is very fashionable,"
she laughed.</p>

<p>"Can nothing make you stay at
home?" I asked beseechingly.</p>

<p>"I wonder if there ever was a husband
who did not love to tease his wife?"</p>

<p>"The divorce courts have records of
many such unloving wretches."</p>

<p>"What I want," she told me, returning
to her wish, "is to have you take it
up just where you left off. Tell about
your pneumonia, and how Mrs. Blodgett
found your journal, but didn't dare give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
it to me till the doctor was certain you
would recover; and then tell of my sending
you flowers and jellies and everything
I could think of, by her, to help you get
well. How"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I should have eaten twice as much
and recovered much more quickly if she
had only let me know from whom they
really came," I interjected in an aggrieved
tone.</p>

<p>"And tell how I wouldn't listen to
that scoundrel till you should have a
chance to justify yourself; how, the moment
I had read your diary, I wrote and
rejected him, and would not see him
when he called; how he would not accept
his dismissal, but followed me to
the country; tell how dreadfully in the
way he was that evening, till Mrs. Blodgett
and Agnes and I trapped him into
a game of whist"&mdash;</p>

<p>"You Machiavellis!"</p>

<p>"Tell all about my confession, and
how we all spoiled you for those months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
at My Fancy. Oh, weren't they lovely,
Donald?"</p>

<p>"I thought so then."</p>

<p>"But not now?"</p>

<p>"A gooseberry is good till you taste a
strawberry. There was a good deal too
much gooseberry, as I remember."</p>

<p>"Then tell how the papers and people
chattered about your assuming your
true name; and how they gabbled when
we were married,&mdash;and how, on our
wedding day, we endowed the hospital
ward"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Haven't you made a slip in the pronoun?"</p>

<p>"I'll box your ears if you even suggest
it again; half of the money was
what you earned&mdash;endowed the hospital
ward in memory of <i>our</i> dear father,
and how happy we've been since."</p>

<p>"You've made a mistake in the last
pronoun, I'm certain."</p>

<p>"You will write it to please me, Donald?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Maizie, I can't. It's all too
dear to me."</p>

<p>"Please, Don, try?"</p>

<p>"But"&mdash;</p>

<p>She interrupted my protest. "Donald,"
she said, the tenderness in her face
and voice softening her words, "before
knowing that I loved you, you insisted
that debt must be paid. Won't you pay
me now, dear?"</p>

<p>"I don't merely owe you money,
Maizie!" I cried. "I owe you everything,
and I'm a brute to the most generous
of women. Give me the book,
dear heart."</p>

<p>"You'll make it nice, like the rest,
won't you?" she begged.</p>

<p>"I'll try." And then I laughingly
added, "Maizie, you still have the technical
part of story-telling to learn."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I can't write all you wish and make
it symmetrical. In the first place, we
don't want to spend so much time on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
Whitely as to give him a fictitious value;
and next, to be artistic, we must end with
our good-night that evening."</p>

<p>"Well, that will do, if you'll only tell
it nicely."</p>

<p>And that, my dears, is why I write
again of those old days, so distant now
in time and mood. What is told here is
shared with you only to please my love,
and I ask of you that it shall be a confidence.
And of Another I beg that each
of you in time may find a love as strong
as that told here; that each may be as
true and noble as your mother, and as
happy as your father.</p>

<p>Good-night, my children. Good-night,
my love. May God be as good to you
as he has been to me.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
